# OCM Conformance Scenario: Sovereign Cloud Delivery

This conformance scenario validates one of our core value statements: **modeling, signing, transporting, and deploying a multi-service product into an air-gapped sovereign cloud environment**.

## Overview

Implements the reference scenario defined in [ADR-0015](../../../docs/adr/0015_sovereign_cloud_reference_scenario.md) to demonstrate:

- Real multi-service application with genuine dependencies
- Component modeling and construction
- Digital signing and verification workflows
- Air-gap transport via CTF (Common Transport Format)
- Deployment on air-gapped infrastructure using OCM Controller + kro + FluxCD

## Architecture

The scenario deploys a minimal notes application with PostgreSQL backend:

- **sovereign-notes**: Go web service with REST API for notes management
- **PostgreSQL**: Official postgres image deployed as StatefulSet
- **sovereign-product**: Meta component that orchestrates both services

### Air-Gap Transport Flow

Artifacts move from the developer workstation across an air-gap boundary into the cluster registry. The developer builds components into a CTF archive and signs them with a private key. The transfer step verifies the signature before copying into a separate air-gap CTF. Only the public key enters the cluster (as a Kubernetes secret) — the private key never leaves the developer workstation.

```mermaid

    subgraph dev["Developer Workstation"]
        build["build:product"] --> ctf["CTF Archive\n(signed)"]
        keys["RSA Key Pair"]
    end

    subgraph airgap["Air-Gap Boundary"]
        ctf -- "verify + copy" --> agctf["Air-Gap CTF"]
    end

    subgraph cluster["Kind Cluster"]
        agctf -- "cluster:import" --> reg["OCI Registry\nregistry:5000"]
        secret["K8s Secret\n(public key only)"]
    end

    keys -. "public key" .-> secret
```

### Bootstrap and Self-Management Lifecycle

The system has a two-phase lifecycle. In Phase 1, `kubectl apply bootstrap.yaml` creates the OCM CR chain (Repository, Component, Resource, Deployer) which delivers the ResourceGraphDefinition into the cluster. In Phase 2, a user creates a `SovereignProduct` CR. kro processes it via the RGD, which regenerates the same bootstrap CRs (idempotently) plus application resources. The system is now self-managing — changing `spec.version` triggers the full reconciliation chain automatically.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph phase1["Phase 1: Bootstrap (manual, one-time)"]
        apply["kubectl apply bootstrap.yaml"]
        apply --> repo["Repository\nsovereign-repo"]
        repo --> comp["Component\nsovereign-product-component\n(verify signature)"]
        comp --> res["Resource\nsovereign-product-resource-rgd\n(extract RGD blob)"]
        res --> deployer["Deployer\nsovereign-product-deployer\n(apply RGD to cluster)"]
    end

    deployer --> rgd["ResourceGraphDefinition\n(installed in cluster)"]

    subgraph phase2["Phase 2: Self-Management (automatic)"]
        sp["SovereignProduct CR\nspec.version: 1.0.0"] --> rgd
        rgd --> bootstrap_crs["Repository → Component →\nResource → Deployer\n(same CRs, idempotent)"]
        rgd --> pg_chain["postgres:\nResource CRs → OCIRepository → HelmRelease"]
        rgd --> notes_chain["notes:\nResource CRs → OCIRepository → HelmRelease"]
        rgd --> config["ConfigMap + Secret\n(app configuration)"]
    end
```

### Why kro?

[kro](https://kro.run) is a Kubernetes controller that turns a ResourceGraphDefinition (RGD) into a custom resource — in this case `SovereignProduct` — and manages the full tree of child resources declared in the RGD.

This scenario uses kro because it solves four problems at once:

- **Single configuration surface.** Operators create one `SovereignProduct` CR instead of applying 15 individual resources. The RGD schema exposes only the knobs that matter (version, replicas, DB credentials, resource limits).
- **Dependency ordering.** kro evaluates `readyWhen` CEL expressions to gate resource creation — Repository must be Ready before Component, Component before Resource, and so on — so resources are never created before their dependencies exist.
- **Self-management.** The RGD includes the same Repository / Component / Resource / Deployer CRs that delivered it. After bootstrap, kro reconciles these idempotently, so the system manages its own delivery pipeline.
- **Bridge between controllers.** kro translates OCM Resource status fields (registry, repository, digest) into FluxCD inputs (OCIRepository URLs, HelmRelease chart refs, image tags) via CEL expressions. Neither the OCM Controller nor FluxCD needs to know about the other.

In practice, the flow works like this: the OCM Deployer CR installs the RGD into the cluster. kro registers the `SovereignProduct` CRD. When a `SovereignProduct` CR is created, kro creates all 15 resources in dependency order, interpolating CEL expressions like `${postgresChartResource.status.additional.oci.registry}` to wire OCM outputs into FluxCD inputs.

### Controller Reconciliation Chain

Three controllers divide responsibilities across the deployment pipeline. The OCM Controller manages component resolution and signature verification. kro processes the ResourceGraphDefinition to expand `SovereignProduct` CRs into the full resource tree. FluxCD handles the final-mile deployment of Helm charts and container images into the cluster.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph ocm["OCM Controller"]
        repository["Repository"] --> component["Component\n(verify sig)"]
        component --> res_rgd["Resource\n(product-rgd)"]
        component --> res_chart["Resource\n(helm-chart)"]
        component --> res_image["Resource\n(image)"]
        res_rgd --> deployer["Deployer"]
    end

    subgraph kro["kro"]
        deployer --> rgd2["RGD"]
        rgd2 --> sp2["SovereignProduct\nprocessing"]
    end

    subgraph flux["FluxCD"]
        res_chart -. "registry/repo/digest" .-> oci_repo["OCIRepository"]
        oci_repo --> helm["HelmRelease"]
        res_image -. "image ref" .-> helm
        helm --> workload["Deployment /\nStatefulSet"]
    end
```

## Success Criteria

A successful conformance run validates:

1. **Component Construction**: All three components build without errors
2. **Signing**: Components are signed with RSA-PSS and signatures verify
3. **Transport**: CTF archive transfers to air-gapped registry with resource localization
4. **Deployment**: OCM Controller successfully deploys all components
5. **Integration**: Notes service connects to PostgreSQL and serves traffic
6. **Upgrade**: Version bump triggers automatic rolling update

## Integration Points

This scenario serves as a conformance test for:

- OCM CLI component operations
- OCM Controller Kubernetes integration
- CTF transport format compatibility  
- ResourceGraphDefinition (kro) deployment patterns
- FluxCD source controller integration
- Multi-component dependency resolution
- Air-gap registry workflows

## Contributing

To extend this scenario:

1. Modify components in `components/` directories
2. Update versions in `Taskfile.yml` variables
3. Run `task run` to verify the full conformance scenario passes
4. Document changes in this README

This scenario should remain a complete, working example that new OCM adopters can use as a reference implementation.
