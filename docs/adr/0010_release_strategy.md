# ADR: Monorepo Versioning, Branching & Release Strategy

* **Status:** proposed
* **Deciders:** OCM Technical Steering Committee
* **Date:** 2025‑09-30

---

## Technical Story

Enable fast, reliable releases from the new monorepo using Git‑native, tag‑only versioning and a simple branching model, while keeping a clean path to introduce an optional root component later.

### Context and Problem Statement

We have already consolidated two components into our monorepo

* cli - CLI v2
* kubernetes/controller - controller v2

and will add a third component later:

* website - OCM website

The team already operates GitHub‑based release workflows for OCM v1. We considered carrying over VERSION files, but decided to converge on **Git‑native, tag‑only** versioning for a single, immutable source of truth.

### Important scope decisions

* **Lockstep MAJOR/MINOR:** Both sub‑components use **the same X.Y** at sprint start. This is supportive for an `ocm` root component to be introduced later, which will share X.Y and patch in tandem when any sub-component patches.
* **Per‑component PATCH:** Patch releases may happen independently per sub‑component **between** sprints.
* **Promotion of RC to final** happens using the same artifacts produced by the RC build for the final release (no rebuild).

### Out of scope (for this ADR)

* **Emergency patches:** Any special treatment/definition of emergency patches; we define the process only for "normal" patches.
* **Support policy details beyond y‑2:** We set **y‑2** support (≈3 months) now; exact branch retirement/EOL steps will be defined later.
* **Testing strategy expansion:** Beyond current component‑specific tests; additional integration/system/conformance testing is excluded from this ADR.

---

## Decision Drivers

* Fast time‑to‑delivery from the monorepo.
* Git tags as single source of truth for versions.
* Compatibility with a future optional root component without reworking fundamentals.
* RC promotion workflow without rebuilds to fulfil SLSA recommendations.

---

## Options

### Version storage

* **V1 — VERSION files per component**

  * Each component stores its version in-tree (e.g., `cli/VERSION`, `kubernetes/cli/VERSION`).

* **V2 — Git tags only (tag‑only)**

  * Annotated tags per component are the single source of truth (e.g., `cli/vX.Y.Z[-rc.N]`).

### Branching strategy

* **B1 — Unified, single release branch per MINOR**

  * One branch for the repo per train: `releases/X.Y`. Every component releases from here; each receives its **own tags**, e.g., `cli/vX.Y.Z`, `kubernetes/controller/vX.Y.Z`.

* **B2 — Multiple release branches (one per component)**

  * `releases/cli/X.Y`, `releases/kubernetes/controller/X.Y` maintained in parallel, per‑component.

* **B3 — No permanent maintenance branches**

  * Patch on temporary branches checked out from final release tags; cherry‑pick fixes; delete after release.

---

## Decision Outcome

We will implement the combination of **V2 + B1** (Git tags only and a unified single release branch per MINOR). We will keep lockstep MAJOR/MINOR and allow per‑component PATCH between sprints.

**Why this combination?**

* Git tags as single SoT eliminate VERSION file/tag drift and reduce bump‑PR noise.
* Unified release branches `releases/X.Y` reduce operational complexity while preserving per‑component tags.
* Technical implementation not more difficult than option V2, but more future-proof and avoids later migration from V1 to V2
* An `ocm` root component can later be created from the same branch and tagged to match X.Y; root PATCH can be triggered in tandem when any sub‑component patches.

---

## Pros and Cons

### Version storage

**V2 — Git tags only (selected)**

* **Pros:** Single immutable SoT in Git; no bump PRs; cleaner history.
* **Cons:** Requires robust automation.

**V1 — VERSION files (not selected)**

* **Pros:** Familiar to the team; explicit in tree.
* **Cons:** Bump PR/commit noise; risk of file/tag drift; requires robust automation.

### Branching strategy

**B1 — Unified single branch per minor (selected)**

* **Pros:** Fewer branches; aligns with lockstep X.Y.
* **Cons:** Requires CI path filters on component level.

**B2 — Per‑component branches (not selected)**

* **Pros:** Isolation when components need divergent stabilization branches.
* **Cons:** More branches/backports; higher operational overhead; weaker alignment with lockstep cadence.

**B3 — No permanent maintenance branches (not selected)**

* **Pros:** Minimal long‑lived branches. Fully git‑native.
* **Cons:** Per‑patch bootstrapping; risk of using wrong base tag; needs strong automation.

## Implementation (Git tags for versioning and unified single release branch per MINOR)

### Tag namespaces

* `cli/vX.Y.Z[-rc.N]`
* `kubernetes/controller/vX.Y.Z[-rc.N]`

### Branching

`releases/X.Y` as the single staging lane for a MINOR release.

### CICD & Guardrails

**Tools:** GitHub Actions for all build and release workflows; protected branches/tags

#### Component-scoped tag discovery

Use `git describe` with `--match` to find the latest tag for a specific component, e.g., for `cli`:

```bash
git describe --tags --match "cli/v[0-9]*" 
```

#### Lockstep gates (MAJOR/MINOR)

* For major/minor RC and final: CI extracts the target X.Y for both components and fails if they differ.
* For patch releases: the gate applies only to the affected component (no lockstep check).

#### Preventing wrong tags

* Protect tag patterns: cli/v*, kubernetes/controller/v*.
* Deny manual pushes for those patterns (e.g. only allow OCM bot).

#### Release artifact model

* RC artifacts (images/binaries) are produced once and published with RC tags.
* Promotion without rebuild: final tags point to the same digest (OCI images) and the same binary checksums; no new build occurs.
* Provenance/Signatures: RCs are signed/attested (using [actions/attest-build-provenance](https://github.com/actions/attest-build-provenance)); promotion adds a final attestation referencing the same subject digest.

#### GPG-signed tags

All release tags (RC and final) are GPG-signed (`git tag -s`) to satisfy the OpenSSF Best Practices `version_tags_signed` criterion. The release workflows import a GPG key from org-level secrets (`GPG_PRIVATE_KEY_FOR_SIGNING`, `GPG_PASSPHRASE`) using [crazy-max/ghaction-import-gpg](https://github.com/crazy-max/ghaction-import-gpg) before creating any tag.

The corresponding public key is stored at `website/static/gpg/OCM-RELEASES-PUBLIC-CURRENT.gpg` and can be used to verify tags locally:

```bash
gpg --import website/static/gpg/OCM-RELEASES-PUBLIC-CURRENT.gpg
git tag -v <tag>
```

> **TODO:** Consider removing the key expiry (currently 2028-11-10) and relying on a stored revocation certificate instead. For smaller projects like OCM, a non-expiring key with a revocation certificate is simpler operationally and avoids user-facing breakage — e.g., Kubernetes' Nov 2024 incident where an expired package-signing key broke apt/yum installs for all users worldwide. The revocation certificate and private key are stored in the team password vault.

### Rollback & Immutability Policy

* Tags are immutable. Never delete or overwrite a published annotated tag.
* If a final release has a defect, ship a corrective patch (vX.Y.Z+1) and mark the previous final as superseded in the notes.
* RC defects found after promotion follow the same corrective-patch route.

### OCM components produced

Every release publishes three OCM component-versions to `ghcr.io/open-component-model`:

* **`ocm.software/cli`** — six executables (linux/darwin/windows × amd64/arm64) referenced by GitHub release download URL via `wget` access, plus the multi-arch CLI image by digest.
* **`ocm.software/kubernetes/controller`** — controller image and Helm chart, both by digest.
* **`ocm.software/ocm`** — product wrapper; pure `componentReferences` to the two above.

All three carry the same bare semver as the GitHub release, and are published on both RC and final phases so consumers can validate the shape against an RC first.

**Conflict policy:** both phases use `--component-version-conflict-policy replace`, so reruns after a transient failure are idempotent. The `concurrency` group and `create-tag.js` tag-existence checks prevent diverging runs for the same version, so `replace` cannot overwrite a different commit's artifact.

**Resource form:** OCI artefacts (images, chart) are pinned by digest via `access.ociArtifact`. CLI binaries use `wget` access (`relation: external`) pointing at the release download URLs.

See also [RELEASE_PROCESS.md § OCM components produced](../../RELEASE_PROCESS.md#ocm-components-produced).

### Roles and Responsibilities

* **Release Manager:** Orchestrates sprint releases, coordinates RC promotions, decides on emergency patches.  
* **Maintainers:** Ensure component readiness, validate release quality (together with PO).  
* **TSC (Technical Steering Committee):** Approves major changes to release process governance (e.g., changes to the release branching model, tag immutability policy, or support policy).

### Decision Gates

* **RC → Release Promotion:** Release Manager decision, with maintainer sign-off.
* **Patch Approval:** Release Manager decision
* **Major Policy Changes:** TSC approval (e.g., changes in support policy, release branching, or tag immutability).

### Example Workflow: Sprint Cycle and Orchestrated Release Day

#### Sprint N: Development Phase (2 weeks)

```bash
# Create release branch from main for new minor version
git checkout main
git checkout -b releases/v0.9
git push origin releases/v0.9

# Create RCs for all components on new release branch
cli/v0.9.0-rc.1
kubernetes/controller/v0.9.0-rc.1
```

#### Sprint N+1: RC Testing Phase (2 weeks)

```bash
# Bug found in CLI during RC testing
git checkout releases/v0.9
git cherry-pick <bugfix>    #from main

# Increment RC versions for affected components (trigger release workflow for new RC)
cli/v0.9.0-rc.2                     ← RC incremented due to patch
kubernetes/controller/v0.9.0-rc.1   ← unchanged
```

#### Sprint N+1 End: Orchestrated Release Day

**Release Manager orchestrates:** ALL current RCs get promoted to finals

```bash
# All RCs are promoted (no rebuilds)
cli/v0.9.0 
kubernetes/controller/v0.9.0

# Start next cycle - create new release branch + RCs
releases/v0.10 → cli/v0.10.0-rc.1, kubernetes/controller/v0.10.0-rc.1
```

#### Maintenance Patches During Sprints

```bash
# Security fix for previous cli release (already finalized)
git checkout releases/0.8  # previous release branch
git cherry-pick <security-fix>

# Create patch RCs for maintenance release
cli/v0.8.1-rc.1
kubernetes/controller/v0.8.0  ← keep same version if unaffected
```

#### Clarifications for Consistency

* PATCH version freedom vs. lockstep: It is intentional that `cli` can be at vX.Y.Z1 while controller remains at vX.Y.Z0 within the same X.Y line. MINORs are in lockstep; PATCHes are per component.
* RC period length: Default RC soak aligns with the sprint cadence. Maintenance patches may use a shorter RC period (risk-based), especially for security fixes.

### Release notes

* Per component, generated via path‑scoped diffs (e.g., `<root>/cli/**`, `<root>/kubernetes/controller/**`).
* Following same structure as in OCM v1 release, see [example](https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm/releases/tag/v0.30.0)

### Support Policy (y‑2 / ~3 months)

We will support the latest 3 MINOR versions (y, y‑1, y‑2). EOL activities for branches will be revisited later.
