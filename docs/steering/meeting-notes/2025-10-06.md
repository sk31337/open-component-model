## Votes

  > The security officer is the public contact for security related questions, issues and reports of the project.
  Currently, it is sufficient to list the TSC member holding the security role in the OWNERS.md. The security officer
  role can be held by any TSC member (including the chairperson) or other project contributors. Specific guidelines on
  the exact set of responsibilities and guidelines for the security officer are a future topic for the TAC.

## Action Items

  reuse under Apache 2.0 or MIT to conform with Charter.

      2.0)
    - ODG Delivery relies on Python as Runtime which contain OS artifacts as well as Database dependencies (
          Postgres)
    - Bash is a typical candidate as well as gcc
  - Looking for SME on LICENSE resolution
  - [ ] Philipp to create a ticket in OCM Github Organization to track this issue
  - [ ] Philipp to clarify how other orgs that are known affected deal with this (i.e. Gardener)
  - [ ] IP Scan we are not safe on the Source Code Repositories within ODG, we will defer this until ODG provides a
      blackduck IP integration (Issue Link TBD)
- [ ] Currently SAP OSPO still has Ownership and Jakob will reach out to them to limit Ownership. Jakob to create a
  small offboarding timeline together with SAP OSPO
  - Generally we can offboard anytime we want
  - Jakob would like to defer this move until NeoNephos Project Guidelines are in place and public
  - Jakob is trying to get the NeoNephos Project Guidelines published
    - Depends on Approval of TAC and needs to be ratified by it before it can be referenced
- [ ] Philipp to communicate options for ODG website so ODG maintainers can decide on preference
