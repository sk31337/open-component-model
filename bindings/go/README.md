## Usage

Import the modules you need:

```go
import (
    "ocm.software/open-component-model/bindings/go/oci"
    "ocm.software/open-component-model/bindings/go/descriptor/v2"
)
```

## Examples

The [`examples/`](examples/) directory contains runnable, tested examples for the most common OCM operations:

- **Blobs** — creating in-memory and filesystem blobs, copying with digest verification
- **Descriptors** — building component descriptors with resources, sources, references, and labels
- **Credentials** — resolving credentials by identity using the static resolver
- **Signing** — generating and verifying digests, RSA signing (plain and PEM), tamper detection
- **Repository** — creating CTF-backed repositories, storing and retrieving component versions, resources, and sources
- **OCI Registry** — full round-trip against a real OCI registry using testcontainers (skipped with `-short`)
- **Transfer** — transferring component versions between CTF repositories using the transfer graph API

All examples are self-contained and run as part of CI, except **OCI Registry** which requires a real OCI registry via
testcontainers and is skipped with `-short`:

```bash
task bindings/go/examples:test
```

## Testing

```bash
# Run all library tests
task test
# Run specific tests
go test ./...
```

## Exploring tasks

```bash
# Run from repository root
task -a
```
