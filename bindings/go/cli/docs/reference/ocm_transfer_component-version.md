## ocm transfer component-version

Transfer one or more component versions between OCM repositories

### Synopsis

Transfer component version(s) from a source repository to
a target repository using an internally generated transformation graph.

When a version is included in the source reference, exactly that version is transferred.
When the version is omitted, all versions of the component are discovered and transferred.
Use --constraint to restrict which versions are selected, and --latest to transfer
only the newest matching version.

OCI, CTF, and Helm repositories are supported as transfer sources.
OCI and CTF repositories are supported as transfer targets, while Helm repositories are not supported.

By default, local blobs are copied and all other resources stay by reference (their access
is unchanged in the target). Uploader configurations in the OCM configuration decide
what happens to a resource: oci.uploader.transfer.config.ocm.software/v1alpha1 (separate OCI
artifacts), http.uploader.transfer.config.ocm.software/v1alpha1 (custom HTTP targets),
localblob.uploader.transfer.config.ocm.software/v1alpha1 (copy as local blobs) and
reference.uploader.transfer.config.ocm.software/v1alpha1 (keep by reference). Each selects
resources with a CEL match expression over resource and target (test access types with
resource.access.isType("OCIImage"), which resolves aliases and versions); the first uploader
whose match is true handles the resource. The deprecated --copy-resources and --upload-as flags
still work: they are translated into uploader entries appended after the configured ones (see
the "Migrate from --upload-as to Uploader Configurations" guide on ocm.software). --recursive walks the
component's references and transfers them too.

Driving defaults from the OCM configuration:
  A transfer.config.ocm.software/v1alpha1 entry inside the central OCM configuration
  (passed via --config) sets defaults for --recursive.
  Explicit command-line flags always override the values from the configuration.

Two-step workflow (generate, review, replay):
  --dry-run builds and validates the graph without executing it, and with -o yaml|json prints
  the resulting TransformationGraphDefinition. --transfer-spec then replays a saved definition
  from a file (or stdin with "-"):
    1. Generate the spec:  transfer cv --dry-run -o yaml -r {reference} {target} > spec.yaml
    2. Review/edit spec.yaml, then execute: transfer cv --transfer-spec spec.yaml
  All graph-shaping flags (--recursive, --copy-resources, --upload-as) and any transfer or uploader
  configuration entry are baked into the spec during step 1 and are therefore ignored in
  step 2 - the spec is the full graph definition. Only --dry-run, --output, and
  --concurrency-limit remain meaningful when replaying a spec.

How the graph is built:
  Internally the command assembles a TransformationGraphDefinition from these node types,
  selected based on the source/target references:
    1. CTFGetComponentVersion -> OCIGetComponentVersion
    2. CTFAddComponentVersion -> OCIAddComponentVersion
    3. GetOCIArtifact -> OCIAddLocalResource, or TransferOCIArtifact (OCI uploader)
    4. GetHelmChart -> ConvertHelmToOCI -> OCIAddLocalResource / AddOCIArtifact (OCI uploader)

### Examples

```
# Transfer a component version from a CTF archive to an OCI registry
transfer component-version ctf::./my-archive//ocm.software/mycomponent:1.0.0 ghcr.io/my-org/ocm

# Transfer from one OCI registry to another
transfer component-version ghcr.io/source-org/ocm//ocm.software/mycomponent:1.0.0 ghcr.io/target-org/ocm

# Transfer all versions of a component (omit version from reference)
transfer component-version ctf::./my-archive//ocm.software/mycomponent ghcr.io/my-org/ocm

# Transfer all versions matching a version constraint
transfer component-version ctf::./my-archive//ocm.software/mycomponent ghcr.io/my-org/ocm --constraint ">= 1.0.0, < 2.0.0"

# Transfer only the latest version
transfer component-version ctf::./my-archive//ocm.software/mycomponent ghcr.io/my-org/ocm --latest

# Upload OCI images, Helm charts and OCI-manifest local blobs as separate OCI artifacts and copy
# every other resource as a local blob. With ./.ocmconfig in the working directory (merged with
# your other OCM configuration files) containing:
#   type: generic.config.ocm.software/v1
#   configurations:
#   - type: oci.uploader.transfer.config.ocm.software/v1alpha1
#   - type: localblob.uploader.transfer.config.ocm.software/v1alpha1
transfer component-version ghcr.io/source-org/ocm//ocm.software/mycomponent:1.0.0 ghcr.io/target-org/ocm

# Keep one resource by reference and copy all others as local blobs. With ./.ocmconfig containing:
#   type: generic.config.ocm.software/v1
#   configurations:
#   - type: reference.uploader.transfer.config.ocm.software/v1alpha1
#     match: resource.name == "base-os-image"
#   - type: localblob.uploader.transfer.config.ocm.software/v1alpha1
transfer component-version ghcr.io/source-org/ocm//ocm.software/mycomponent:1.0.0 ghcr.io/target-org/ocm

# Drive defaults from the OCM configuration. With --config ./ocmconfig.yaml containing:
#   type: generic.config.ocm.software/v1
#   configurations:
#   - type: transfer.config.ocm.software/v1alpha1
#     recursive: -1
#   - type: localblob.uploader.transfer.config.ocm.software/v1alpha1
# the following invocation transfers recursively with all resources copied.
# Any explicit flag still overrides the corresponding configuration value.
transfer component-version --config ./ocmconfig.yaml ghcr.io/source-org/ocm//ocm.software/mycomponent:1.0.0 ghcr.io/target-org/ocm

# Two-step transfer: generate a spec with all desired flags, then review and execute
transfer component-version --dry-run -o yaml -r ghcr.io/source-org/ocm//ocm.software/mycomponent:1.0.0 ghcr.io/target-org/ocm > spec.yaml
# (review/edit spec.yaml as needed, e.g. change the target registry)
transfer component-version --transfer-spec spec.yaml
```

### Options

```
      --concurrency-limit int   maximum number of transformation nodes processed in parallel; independent nodes run concurrently while dependency ordering is preserved. Increase it to speed up large graphs, decrease it to reduce load on the registry (default 4)
      --constraint string       version constraint evaluated by each version's configured scheme; versions with no applicable scheme are retained (e.g. ">= 1.0.0, < 2.0.0"); only used when no version is specified in the reference
      --copy-resources          deprecated: copy all resources in the component version
      --dry-run                 build and validate the graph but do not execute
  -h, --help                    help for component-version
      --latest                  if set, only the latest version of the component is transferred; only used when no version is specified in the reference
  -o, --output enum             output format of the component descriptors
                                (must be one of [json ndjson yaml]) (default yaml)
  -r, --recursive               recursively discover and transfer component versions
      --transfer-spec string    path to a transfer specification file (use "-" for stdin). The input must hold exactly one transfer spec document; with "-", OCM configuration documents in stdin are applied as configuration
  -u, --upload-as enum          deprecated: define whether copied resources should be uploaded as OCI artifacts
                                (must be one of [localBlob ociArtifact]) (default localBlob)
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --config stringArray                 supply configuration by a given configuration file.
                                           By default (without specifying custom locations with this flag), the file will be read from one of the well known locations:
                                           1. The path specified in the OCM_CONFIG environment variable
                                           2. The XDG_CONFIG_HOME directory (if set), or the default XDG home ($HOME/.config), or the user's home directory
                                           - $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ocm/config
                                           - $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/.ocmconfig
                                           - $HOME/.config/ocm/config
                                           - $HOME/.config/.ocmconfig
                                           - $HOME/.ocm/config
                                           - $HOME/.ocmconfig
                                           3. The current working directory:
                                           - $PWD/.ocm/config
                                           - $PWD/.ocmconfig
                                           4. The directory of the current executable:
                                           - $EXE_DIR/.ocm/config
                                           - $EXE_DIR/.ocmconfig
                                           If multiple configuration files are found, they will be merged in the order they are discovered.
                                           Later entries have higher priority.
                                           Using the option, the specified configuration file(s) will be used instead of the lookup above.
                                           Configuration documents piped into stdin are applied last, on top of these files.

                                              info:  Show informational messages and above
                                              warn:  Show warnings and errors only (default)
                                              error: Show errors only
                                           (must be one of [debug error info warn]) (default info)
