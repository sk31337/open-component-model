# kustomize-configuration-localization

Deploys podinfo via a component version that ships its kustomize manifests as
a Flux-consumable OCI artifact embedded in the component, plus the podinfo
container image as a separate resource. The RGD wires both into a Flux
`OCIRepository` + `Kustomization` (and an ArgoCD `Application`) and patches
the image reference and `PODINFO_UI_MESSAGE` env var.

## How the kustomize artifact is built

The `kustomize-resource` uses a `dir/v1` input pointing at `./oci-layout`
with media type `application/vnd.ocm.software.oci.layout.v1+tar`.
`./oci-layout` is not checked in. Build it from `./kustomize/` with `oras`
before running `ocm add cv`:

```bash
tar -czf kustomize.tar.gz -C ./kustomize .
oras push --oci-layout ./oci-layout:latest \
  --artifact-type application/vnd.cncf.flux.config.v1+json \
  kustomize.tar.gz:application/vnd.cncf.flux.content.v1.tar+gzip
```

The layer's `application/vnd.cncf.flux.content.v1.tar+gzip` media type is
what Flux's `OCIRepository` and ArgoCD expect. ArgoCD additionally requires
this media type in its `ARGOCD_REPO_SERVER_OCI_LAYER_MEDIA_TYPES` allowlist.

`ocm add cv` recognizes the OCM layout media type and stores the layout as
a local blob whose access keeps that media type. Transfer with the OCI uploader
first and the local blob uploader as catch-all, so layout resources are
converted into native OCI artifacts in the target registry and every other
resource is copied there. Add the uploaders to `.ocmconfig` in the working directory. If the file already exists (for example
with the signing key, credentials or resolvers), add only the two uploader entries, in this order, to its `configurations` list;
otherwise create it with this content:

```yaml
type: generic.config.ocm.software/v1
configurations:
  - type: oci.uploader.transfer.config.ocm.software/v1alpha1
  - type: localblob.uploader.transfer.config.ocm.software/v1alpha1
```

```bash
ocm transfer cv <ctf> <registry>
```

> The CLI merges `.ocmconfig` from the current directory with your other OCM configuration (such as `$HOME/.ocmconfig`), so credentials and resolvers stay in effect.

Without the OCI uploader, the OCI artifact does not exist at the reference the
RGD expects. After transfer, `resource.access.toOCI()` exposes `registry`,
`repository`, and `digest` fields that `rgd.yaml` reads into the
`OCIRepository` and ArgoCD `Application`.

## Editing the kustomize manifests

Edit the files under `./kustomize/`, rebuild `./oci-layout/` afterwards. Do not
commit it.
