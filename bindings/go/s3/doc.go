// Package s3 provides access to OCM resources stored as objects in an S3 or
// S3-compatible bucket.
//
// It implements the "S3" access type: a resource whose bytes are a single
// object in a bucket, described by a
// [ocm.software/open-component-model/bindings/go/s3/spec/access/v2.S3]
// access spec. Besides the bucket and object key, the spec carries a region, a media
// type, a pinned object version (versionId) and — for S3-compatible stores such as
// MinIO, Ceph or R2 — a custom endpoint and path-style addressing. It addresses one
// object rather than a component-version storage backend. Both v1 and v2 wire
// formats of the ocmv1 "s3" access type are supported; see "Wire types" below.
//
// [ocm.software/open-component-model/bindings/go/s3/repository.ResourceRepository]
// is the entry point. It resolves the access spec of a resource, builds an
// aws-sdk-go-v2 client, performs a GetObject and returns the object body as a blob:
//
//	repo := repository.NewResourceRepository(filesystemConfig)
//	b, err := repo.DownloadResource(ctx, resource, credentials)
//	if err != nil {
//	    return err
//	}
//
// Objects are streamed into a file under the TempFolder of the supplied filesystem
// config (a nil config selects the OS temporary directory) rather than buffered, so
// memory use does not scale with object size. That file outlives the call and is
// owned by the caller. Upload is not supported yet (download-first, matching ocmv1),
// and integrity uses OCM's own SHA-256 over the content (see ProcessResourceDigest)
// rather than the S3 ETag, which is not a reliable whole-object hash for multipart
// objects.
//
// Credentials are optional. When supplied as
// [ocm.software/open-component-model/bindings/go/s3/spec/credentials/v1.S3Credentials]
// (access key ID, secret access key and an optional session token) they are used as
// static credentials; otherwise the AWS default credential chain applies
// (environment, shared config, IAM instance/task roles). Missing credentials and
// credential-provider or authorization errors never trigger anonymous access.
// To read public objects without signing, supply S3Credentials with Anonymous: true,
// even when AWS credentials are available. Anonymous is optional and defaults to
// false; it cannot be combined with access keys or a session token. Authentication
// belongs only in credentials, never in access or input specs. The legacy ocmv1
// names awsAccessKeyID, awsSecretAccessKey and token are accepted as well.
//
// # Input method
//
// The same object can instead be pulled into a component version while it is built.
// [ocm.software/open-component-model/bindings/go/s3/input.InputMethod] implements the
// constructor's resource input method for the "S3" input type, described by a
// [ocm.software/open-component-model/bindings/go/s3/spec/input/v2.S3] spec that
// mirrors the fields of the access spec:
//
//	resources:
//	- name: my-object
//	  type: blob
//	  input:
//	    type: S3/v2
//	    bucketName: my-bucket
//	    objectKey: path/to/blob.txt
//
// It downloads the object over the same path a resource download uses and hands it to
// the constructor as local blob data, so the finished component version carries the
// bytes and no longer resolves anything against the bucket. That is the difference to
// the access type, which leaves the object where it is and fetches it on every read.
//
// The input derives its credential consumer identity exactly as the access type does,
// so one consumer entry serves a bucket whether its objects are referenced or taken in.
//
// # Object versions
//
// ProcessResourceDigest pins the access to the versionId the object was read at. A
// version already named in the spec is sent as the request's versionId and must come
// back unchanged; stores reporting no version are taken at their word. An unversioned
// bucket — the default on AWS — reports either no version or the placeholder "null",
// neither of which survives an overwrite, so "null" is never treated as a pin and
// such an object is logged rather than rejected: signing covers the resource digest,
// so an overwritten object fails verification instead of being quietly substituted.
// Enable bucket versioning, or name a versionId, where reproducibility matters.
//
// # HTTP client and TLS
//
// Downloads go through the shared ocm HTTP client, built from an
// [ocm.software/open-component-model/bindings/go/http/spec/config/v1alpha1.Config]
// (timeouts, TLS, per-host overrides). The access spec has no switch to weaken TLS,
// so a descriptor cannot ask for a laxer connection than the configuration allows. A
// client supplied with repository.WithHTTPClient is used exactly as given and brings
// its own settings.
//
// # Retries
//
// On AWS (no custom endpoint), a 301 PermanentRedirect triggers one region
// correction: the download uses x-amz-bucket-region, or HeadBucket if that header
// is absent, and retries GetObject once using the SDK's regional endpoint. This
// can correct an explicitly configured region too. Credentials, object version and
// HTTP settings are preserved; invalid region hints fail rather than following
// Location. Custom endpoints and other GetObject errors do not trigger discovery.
//
// Retrying is left to the aws-sdk-go-v2 client, which retries the whole operation,
// re-signs every attempt and classifies S3's error codes; transport retry is switched
// off for the client handed to the SDK, globally and per host. retry.maxRetries counts
// the attempts after the first, the SDK counts the first as well:
//
//	maxRetries: 3    // 4 attempts
//	maxRetries: -1   // 1 attempt, no retrying
//	maxRetries: 0    // infinite, bounded only by ctx and the SDK's retry quota
//	(unset)          // the SDK's own default of 3 attempts, honouring
//	                 // AWS_MAX_ATTEMPTS and AWS_RETRY_MODE
//
// A per-host entry for the endpoint overrides the global setting, so this gives a
// MinIO download 11 attempts and every other download 4:
//
//	retry:
//	  maxRetries: 3
//	hosts:
//	  "minio.internal:9000":
//	    retry:
//	      maxRetries: 10
//
// On AWS the request host is derived by the SDK's endpoint resolver and is not known
// when the client is built, so a per-host entry does not reach it and the global
// setting stands. A download's wall-clock ceiling is roughly the attempt count times
// the configured OCM timeout; by default there is no wall-clock limit. SDK
// retry ends once the response headers are deserialised, so it does not cover a
// body that fails mid-stream.
//
// # Credential consumer identity
//
// GetResourceCredentialConsumerIdentity resolves the identity a credential resolver
// matches against. It always carries the type S3 and the object path, and a
// host only for a custom endpoint:
//
//	AWS S3 (no endpoint):
//		type: S3
//		path: <bucketName>/<objectKey>
//
//	custom endpoint (MinIO, Ceph, R2):
//		type:     S3
//		scheme:   https            // the endpoint scheme (http for a plaintext MinIO)
//		hostname: minio.internal   // the endpoint host
//		port:     9000             // when the endpoint sets one
//		path:     <bucketName>/<objectKey>
//
// AWS carries no hostname because it is the default target and the matcher requires
// equal hostnames, so a config that set one would not match. The path is matched with
// path.Match, whose "*" does not cross "/", so a config either omits the path or gives
// the exact bucketName/objectKey; region, mediaType, version and the path-style switch
// take no part in matching. The identity type is the one ocmv1 uses, but ocmv1 scoped
// entries by a pathprefix key, which is not resolved: such an entry never matches.

//
// # Wire types
//
// The wire types are registered in their package scheme for typed conversion. The
// access type is the ocmv1 "s3" access type in its v2 format (bucketName, objectKey),
// extended by endpoint and usePathStyle, and resolves under the ocmv1 spellings of
// that format:
//
//	S3/v2
//	S3
//	s3/v2
//	s3
//
// S3/v1 and s3/v1 use the legacy bucket and key fields, with the same optional
// region, version and mediaType. They also support our endpoint and usePathStyle
// extensions. The v2 access decoder also accepts bucket/key as read aliases for
// bucketName/objectKey, including for unversioned S3 and s3 records. It always
// writes v2 field names; the v2 schema is unchanged. Records containing fields
// from both shapes are rejected as ambiguous.
//
// Access specs are normalized to v2 for processing without modifying the original
// descriptor. When digest processing pins a previously unpinned v1 access, the
// updated access is emitted explicitly as S3/v2 with v2 field names. Unversioned
// v2 aliases retain their type.
// Type matching is exact; field names are matched case-insensitively, as JSON
// decoding is. ocmv1 reads S3/v2 as well, but drops endpoint and usePathStyle and so
// always targets AWS.
//
// The input type resolves under the four v2 names listed above in its own scheme.
// It does not support the legacy v1 access format; ocmv1 has no S3 input type.
