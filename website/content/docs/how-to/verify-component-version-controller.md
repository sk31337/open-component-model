## Goal

Configure the OCM Kubernetes controller to automatically verify component version signatures before reconciling resources.

## You'll end up with

- A `Component` resource that ensures signature verification

**Estimated time:** ~5 minutes

## Prerequisites

- [Controller environment]({{< relref "setup-controller-environment.md" >}}) set up
- A [signed component version]({{< relref "sign-component-version.md" >}}) in a local CTF
  archive
- The public key file at `/tmp/keys/public-key.pem`
  (from [Generate Signing Keys]({{< relref "generate-signing-keys.md" >}}))
- Access to an OCI registry
  (e.g., [ghcr.io](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/learn-github-packages/introduction-to-github-packages))

## Steps

### Transfer the signed component version to the registry

Push your signed component version from the local CTF archive to a remote OCI registry:

```bash
ocm transfer cv /tmp/helloworld/transport-archive//github.com/acme.org/helloworld:1.0.0 ghcr.io/<your-namespace>
```

Verify the upload:

```bash
ocm get cv ghcr.io/<your-namespace>//github.com/acme.org/helloworld:1.0.0
```

COMPONENT                          │ VERSION │ PROVIDER
───────────────────────────────────┼─────────┼──────────────
github.com/acme.org/helloworld     │ 1.0.0   │ acme.org
```
</details>

{{< step >}}

### Prepare the public key

Base64-encode your public key for use in the `Component` resource's `value` field. The controller
expects the PEM file content encoded as a base64 string:

```bash
cat /tmp/keys/public-key.pem | base64 | tr -d '\n'
```

Save the output - you will need it in the next step.

{{< /step >}}

{{< step >}}

### Create the `Repository` resource

Create and apply a `Repository` that points to your OCI registry:

```bash
cat <<EOF > repository.yaml
apiVersion: delivery.ocm.software/v1alpha1
kind: Repository
metadata:
  name: helloworld-repository
spec:
  repositorySpec:
    baseUrl: ghcr.io/<your-namespace>
    type: OCIRegistry
  interval: 10m
EOF
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f repository.yaml
```

{{< /step >}}

{{< step >}}

### Create the `Component` resource with verification

Create and apply a `Component` that references the repository and configures signature verification.
Choose one of the following approaches:

{{< tabs "verification-method" >}}
{{< tab "Inline Value" >}}

Embed the base64-encoded public key directly in the `Component` resource:

```bash
cat <<EOF > component.yaml
apiVersion: delivery.ocm.software/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: helloworld-component
spec:
  component: github.com/acme.org/helloworld
  repositoryRef:
    name: helloworld-repository
  semver: ">=1.0.0"
  interval: 10m
  verify:
    - signature: default
      value: <base64-encoded-public-key>
EOF
```

Replace `<base64-encoded-public-key>` with the output from the previous step.

```bash
kubectl apply -f component.yaml
```

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Kubernetes Secret" >}}

Store the public key in a Kubernetes Secret and reference it from the `Component` resource:

```bash
cat <<EOF > signing-secret.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: signing-verification-secret
data:
  default: <base64-encoded-public-key>
EOF
```

{{< callout context="note" title="Note" icon="outline/info-circle" >}}
The key in the Secret's `data` field must match the signature name used during signing.
If you signed with `--signature prod`, use `prod` as the key name.
{{< /callout >}}

```bash
cat <<EOF > component.yaml
apiVersion: delivery.ocm.software/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: helloworld-component
spec:
  component: github.com/acme.org/helloworld
  repositoryRef:
    name: helloworld-repository
  semver: ">=1.0.0"
  interval: 10m
  verify:
    - signature: default
      secretRef:
        name: signing-verification-secret
EOF
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f signing-secret.yaml -f component.yaml
```

{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

{{< /step >}}

{{< step >}}

### Verify the `Component` is ready

Check that the `Component` resource reconciles successfully with verification:

```bash
kubectl get component helloworld-component -o wide
```

<details>
<summary>Expected output</summary>

```text
NAME                   READY                   AGE
helloworld-component   Applied version 1.0.0   98s
```
</details>

To confirm the signature was actually verified, check the controller logs:

```bash
kubectl logs -n ocm-k8s-toolkit-system deploy/ocm-k8s-toolkit-controller-manager | grep "verifying signature"
```

<details>
<summary>Expected output</summary>

```text
{"level":"info","ts":"2026-04-28T15:58:14Z","msg":"verifying signature","component":"github.com/acme.org/helloworld","version":"1.0.0"}
```
</details>

If verification fails, the `Component` will not become ready and an error condition will be set.

<details>
<summary>Check for failure</summary>

```bash
kubectl get component helloworld-component -o wide
```

```text
NAME                   READY                                                                                                        AGE
helloworld-component   signature verification failed for signature default: missing public key, required for plain RSA signatures   7s
```
</details>

## How verification protects component references

Component references can carry digests. When the controller resolves a reference that includes a
digest, it computes a fresh digest of the referenced component and compares it against the
recorded value. If they do not match, reconciliation fails.

Reference digests are computed and added automatically by `ocm add cv`. The `ocm sign cv`
command checks that the component version is safely digestible and warns if any reference or
resource digests are missing.

## Troubleshooting

When verification fails, the `Component` resource's Ready condition is set to `False` with the
error message. Check it with:

```bash
kubectl get component <name> -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions[?(@.type=="Ready")].message}'
```

### Symptom: "signature verification failed for signature ..."

**Cause:** The verification credential (public key or certificate) does not match the private
key used to sign the component version.

**Fix:** Ensure you are using the correct verification credential that corresponds to the
private key used during signing. Verify the signature name matches by inspecting the component
version:

```bash
ocm get cv ghcr.io/<your-namespace>//github.com/acme.org/helloworld:1.0.0 -o yaml | grep -A 5 "signatures:"
```

### Symptom: "signature ... not found in component"

**Cause:** The component version does not contain a signature with the name specified in the
`verify` section of the `Component` resource spec.

**Fix:** Check which signatures exist on the component version and ensure the `signature` field
in the `verify` section of your `Component` resource matches:

```bash
ocm get cv ghcr.io/<your-namespace>//github.com/acme.org/helloworld:1.0.0 -o yaml | grep -A 5 "signatures:"
```

### Symptom: "digest mismatch ... for component version ...:..."

**Cause:** A parent component version includes a reference to another component version with a
recorded digest. When the controller resolves that reference, the actual content does not match
the recorded digest. This typically means the referenced component was modified or re-published
after the parent recorded its digest.

**Fix:** Inspect the parent component version's references to identify the digest mismatch:

```bash
ocm get cv ghcr.io/<your-namespace>//github.com/acme.org/parent-component:1.0.0 -o yaml
```

Look at the `componentReferences:` section and their `digest` fields. To resolve, rebuild the
parent component version with correct reference digests, re-sign it, and then publish it.

### Symptom: "not safely digestible" event

The `Component` becomes Ready, but a Kubernetes event with severity error is emitted containing
"not safely digestible".

**Cause:** The component version does not satisfy OCM's digest consistency rules:

- Component references must have complete digests (hash algorithm, normalisation algorithm, value)
- Resources with access must have complete digests
- Resources without access must not carry a digest

Without consistent digests, signature verification is skipped because the normalised form cannot
be reliably computed.

**Fix:** Rebuild the component version with consistent digests, re-sign it, and then publish it.
The `ocm sign cv` command warns when a component version is not safely digestible.

### Symptom: "secret not found" or "failed to get secret"

**Cause:** The Secret referenced in `secretRef` does not exist in the same namespace as the
`Component` resource.

**Fix:** Ensure the Secret is created in the same namespace:

```bash
kubectl get secret signing-verification-secret -n <component-namespace>
```

### Symptom: "secret ... does not contain key ... for signature verification"

**Cause:** The Secret does not contain a data entry matching the signature name.

**Fix:** The key in the Secret's `data` field must exactly match the `signature` field in the
`verify` configuration. If your signature is named `default`, the Secret must have a `default`
key:

```yaml
data:
  default: <base64-encoded-public-key>
```
