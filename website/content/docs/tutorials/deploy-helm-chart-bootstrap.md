## What You'll Learn

Your application already ships as a Helm chart, and you want its delivery to be just as repeatable: one versioned
OCM component that carries the chart, its container image, and the instructions to deploy it. Promote that component
from a staging registry to production, or hand it to an air-gapped cluster, and the image references should update
themselves. Patching a values file to correct a registry path is exactly what this avoids.

This tutorial builds that pipeline. You package the chart as an OCM component, capture its deployment as a kro
`ResourceGraphDefinition`, and let the OCM controllers deliver and localize it into the cluster. A GitOps deployer
(Flux or Argo CD) renders the chart, so operators install it without touching its internals.
[Podinfo](https://github.com/stefanprodan/podinfo) stands in for your application.

By the end, you'll have:

- An OCM component containing a Helm chart, an image reference, and deployment instructions
- A running Podinfo application deployed via the bootstrap pattern
- Understanding of how localization keeps image references in sync after transfers

## Prerequisites

{{< callout context="note" title="Set up your environment" icon="outline/settings-check" >}}
Before starting, make sure you have set up your environment as described in the [setup guide]({{< relref "setup-controller-environment.md" >}}).
{{< /callout >}}

- [Controller environment]({{< relref "setup-controller-environment.md" >}}) with OCM Controllers, kro, and a deployer (Flux or Argo CD) installed
- [Custom RBAC]({{< relref "custom-rbac.md" >}}) configured to allow the controller to manage `ResourceGraphDefinitions` (also see [RBAC for CRDs kro creates at runtime]({{< relref "custom-rbac.md#rbac-for-crds-kro-creates-at-runtime" >}}) if you're running a hardened cluster)
- [OCM CLI]({{< relref "ocm-cli-installation.md" >}}) installed
- Access to an OCI registry (e.g., [ghcr.io](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/learn-github-packages/introduction-to-github-packages))
- `envsubst` installed (pre-installed on most Linux/macOS systems; part of `gettext`)

{{< callout context="note" title="Private registries" icon="outline/lock" >}}
If using a private registry, you'll need to configure credentials for both the OCM CLI and the controller resources. See [Configure Credentials for Controllers]({{< relref "docs/how-to/configure-credentials-ocm-controllers.md" >}}) for details.
{{< /callout >}}

## Environment Setup

Set environment variables for your GitHub username and OCM repository:

```bash
export GITHUB_USERNAME=<your-github-username>
export OCM_REPO=ghcr.io/$GITHUB_USERNAME/ocm-tutorial
```

## Concepts

### The Bootstrap Pattern

In the [basic Helm deployment guide]({{< relref "deploy-helm-chart.md" >}}), you manually created a `ResourceGraphDefinition` and applied it to the cluster. The **bootstrap pattern** improves on this by packaging the RGD inside the OCM component itself. The Deployer controller extracts and applies it automatically.

This means:

- Developers define deployment instructions once, alongside their application
- Operators only need to create bootstrap resources pointing to the component
- Deployment instructions travel securely with the software through OCM

### Localization

**Localization** keeps image references in sync when components move between registries:

1. **During transfer**: When you run `ocm transfer cv --copy-resources --upload-as ociArtifact`, OCM uploads artifacts to the new registry as OCI artifacts and updates the descriptor's image references accordingly
2. **During deployment**: The RGD reads the updated image reference from the component and injects it into Helm values

This ensures your deployment always uses images from the current registry, not hardcoded original locations.

## Architecture Overview

The OCM controllers fetch the component and apply the RGD the same way described in
[Concept: Kubernetes Deployer]({{< relref "docs/concepts/kubernetes-deployer.md" >}}). The
diagram below picks up from there: it shows what kro does once it has the RGD, and you can
refer back to it as you work through the steps.

(Continues from [Concept: Kubernetes Deployer]({{< relref "docs/concepts/kubernetes-deployer.md" >}}), which
shows the `Repository` → `Component` → `Resource` → `Deployer` chain that gets the RGD here.)

kro creates a CRD from the RGD, and instantiating that CRD deploys the Helm chart with localized image references.

## Create and Publish a Component Version

First, create an OCM component version containing three resources:

- **helm-resource**: The Podinfo Helm chart
- **image-resource**: The Podinfo container image (for localization)
- **resource-graph-definition**: Deployment instructions

{{< steps >}}
{{< step >}}

### Create a working directory

```shell
mkdir /tmp/bootstrap-deploy && cd /tmp/bootstrap-deploy
```

{{< /step >}}

{{< step >}}

### Define the component

Create a `component-constructor.yaml` file:

```shell
cat > component-constructor.yaml << 'EOF'
components:
  - name: ocm.software/ocm-k8s-toolkit/bootstrap
    version: "1.0.0"
    provider:
      name: ocm.software
    resources:
      - name: helm-resource
        type: helmChart
        version: "1.0.0"
        access:
          type: OCIImage/v1
          imageReference: "ghcr.io/stefanprodan/charts/podinfo:6.11.1@sha256:a9b2804ec61795a7457b2303bf9efbc5fba51f856c3945f3bb0af68bf3b35afd"
      - name: image-resource
        type: ociArtifact
        version: "1.0.0"
        access:
          type: OCIImage/v1
          imageReference: "ghcr.io/stefanprodan/podinfo:6.11.1@sha256:8fa56908408de98f24aed2a162b1bb42c0b98df7abfcc5a76a14a8be510457c5"
      - name: resource-graph-definition
        type: blob
        version: "1.0.0"
        input:
          type: File/v1
          path: ./resourceGraphDefinition.yaml
EOF
```

As you can see, the resource `resource-graph-definition` is of type `blob` and contains the path to a file
`resourceGraphDefinition.yaml`. Before we can create the OCM component version, we need to create this file, with the
following content:

{{< details "ResourceGraphDefinition (resourceGraphDefinition.yaml)" >}}
The `resourceChart` and `resourceImage` resources are identical for both deployers. Both use
`additionalStatusFields`/`toOCI()` to expose the registry, repository, and digest under
`status.additional`; see [Concept: OCM Controllers]({{< relref "docs/concepts/ocm-controllers.md#additional-status-fields" >}})
for how that mechanism works. Choose your deployer tab for the deployer-specific resources:

{{< tabs "bootstrap-rgd-deployer" >}}
{{< tab "Flux" >}}

To make your component public in GitHub Container Registry, go to the `packages` tab in your GitHub repository `https://github.com/<your-github-username>?tab=packages`,
select the package `component-descriptors/ocm.software/ocm-k8s-toolkit/bootstrap`, and under "Package settings" change the visibility to `public`.

Alternatively, if you want to keep your package private, configure
credentials for the OCM Controllers and Flux. You need to do the adjustments in
the resourceGraphDefinition.yaml file BEFORE calling `ocm add cv`:

{{< details "Configure credentials for private registries" >}}
Create a docker-registry secret with your registry credentials. For GitHub Container Registry, you can use a Personal Access Token or a short-lived token from the GitHub CLI:

```shell
kubectl create secret docker-registry ghcr-secret \
  --docker-username=$GITHUB_USERNAME \
  --docker-password="$(gh auth token)" \
  --docker-server=ghcr.io
```

Then update the resources to use credentials:

1. **OCM Controller resources**: Add `ocmConfig` to the Repository in `bootstrap.yaml`. The credentials propagate
   automatically to Component, Resource, and Deployer objects that reference this
   Repository:

   ```yaml
   spec:
     repositorySpec:
       baseUrl: $OCM_REPO
       type: OCIRegistry
     interval: 1m
     ocmConfig:
       - kind: Secret
         name: ghcr-secret
   ```

2. **Flux OCIRepository**: Uncomment `secretRef` in the RGD's ocirepository resource (Flux only):

   ```yaml
   secretRef:
     name: ghcr-secret
   ```

   For Argo CD, credentials are configured at the repository level, not in the Application spec. *See [Argo CD private registry docs](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/declarative-setup/#repositories)*

3. **Pod imagePullSecrets**: The deployed pods also need credentials to pull
images. Add this to the HelmRelease values (Flux) or `valuesObject` (Argo CD) in the RGD:

   ```yaml
   values:        # use valuesObject: for Argo CD
     image:
       repository: ${resourceImage.status.additional.oci.registry}/${resourceImage.status.additional.oci.repository}
       tag: latest@${resourceImage.status.additional.oci.digest}
       pullSecrets:
       - name: ghcr-secret
   ```

For more details, see [Credentials for OCM Controllers]({{< relref "/docs/how-to/configure-credentials-ocm-controllers.md" >}}).
{{< /details >}}
{{< /step >}}

{{< step >}}

### Build and transfer the component

Build the component version locally:

```bash
ocm add cv
```

Transfer to your registry with `--copy-resources --upload-as ociArtifact` to enable localization. The `--upload-as ociArtifact` flag is required so the Helm chart and image land as OCI artifacts in the target registry, keeping image references the RGD can rewrite:

```bash
ocm transfer cv --copy-resources --upload-as ociArtifact transport-archive//ocm.software/ocm-k8s-toolkit/bootstrap:1.0.0 $OCM_REPO
```

{{< /step >}}

{{< step >}}

### Verify the transfer

Check that the component was transferred and resources were localized:

```bash
ocm get cv $OCM_REPO//ocm.software/ocm-k8s-toolkit/bootstrap:1.0.0 -o yaml | grep imageReference
```

You should see image references pointing to `$OCM_REPO/...` instead of the original locations. This confirms localization worked.
{{< /step >}}
{{< /steps >}}

## Deploy the Helm Chart

Now create the bootstrap resources that will fetch and apply the RGD from the component.

{{< steps >}}
{{< step >}}

### Create bootstrap resources

The bootstrap resources form a chain: Repository → Component → Resource → Deployer. The Deployer extracts the RGD and applies it to the cluster.

Create `bootstrap.yaml` with the following content:

{{< callout context="note" title="Private registries" icon="outline/lock" >}}
If you chose to keep your package private, do not forget to add the
secret to the repository's `ocmConfig`, as described above!
{{< /callout >}}

### Apply the bootstrap resources

{{< callout context="caution" title="RBAC required before you apply" icon="outline/alert-triangle" >}}
Please make sure that you updated your RBAC permissions before applying this command. Follow our [Configure Custom RBAC for Deployers]({{< relref "custom-rbac.md" >}}) guide to know how to do that.
{{< /callout >}}

```bash
envsubst < bootstrap.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```

Wait for the RGD to become active (this may take 30-60 seconds):

```bash
kubectl get rgd -w
```

<details>
<summary>You should see this output</summary>

```console
NAME        APIVERSION   KIND        STATE    AGE
bootstrap   v1alpha1     Bootstrap   Active   2m56s
```

</details>

When the state shows `Active`, kro has processed the RGD and created a new CRD called `Bootstrap`.
{{< /step >}}

{{< step >}}

### Create an instance

Now create an instance of the Bootstrap CRD to trigger the actual deployment. Create `instance.yaml`:

```shell
cat > instance.yaml << 'EOF'
apiVersion: kro.run/v1alpha1
kind: Bootstrap
metadata:
  name: bootstrap
EOF
```

{{< /step >}}

{{< step >}}

### Deploy the application

Apply the instance to the cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f instance.yaml
```

<details>
<summary>You should see this output</summary>

```console
bootstrap.kro.run/bootstrap created
```

</details>

Wait for the deployment to complete:

```bash
kubectl get bootstrap -w
```

<details>
<summary>You should see this output</summary>

```console
NAME        STATE    SYNCED   AGE
bootstrap   ACTIVE   True     3m23s
```

</details>

If the instance is in the `ACTIVE` state, the deployment succeeded.

### Verify localization

Check that the deployed pod uses the localized image from your registry (not the original `ghcr.io/stefanprodan/...`):

```bash
kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name=bootstrap-release-podinfo -o jsonpath='{.items[0].spec.containers[0].image}'
```

<details>
<summary>You should see this output</summary>

```console
ghcr.io/$GITHUB_USERNAME/component-descriptors/ocm.software/ocm-k8s-toolkit/bootstrap:latest@sha256:262578cde928d5c9eba3bce079976444f624c13ed0afb741d90d5423877496cb
```

</details>

The image reference points to your registry with a digest. Localization worked!

{{< callout context="caution" title="Going to production: tighten kro's RBAC" icon="outline/lock" >}}
This tutorial uses a dev-friendly kro install with broad permissions (see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)).
A hardened cluster locks that down; see [RBAC for CRDs kro creates at runtime]({{< relref "custom-rbac.md#rbac-for-crds-kro-creates-at-runtime" >}})
for why kro needs its own grant, separate from the `resourcegraphdefinitions.kro.run` grant the
OCM controller already needs. For this tutorial, grant kro's service account
`bootstraps.kro.run` (the instance) and `resources.delivery.ocm.software` (the chart and image),
plus `ocirepositories.source.toolkit.fluxcd.io` and `helmreleases.helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io` for
Flux, or `applications.argoproj.io` for Argo CD.

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Errors (401 Unauthorized)

If you see `401: unauthorized` errors, your GitHub package is private. Either:

- Make the package public in GitHub Package settings
- Configure credentials as described in the collapsible section after "Verify the Transfer"

### RGD Not Becoming Active

Check controller logs:

```bash
kubectl logs -n ocm-k8s-toolkit-system deployment/ocm-k8s-toolkit-controller-manager
```

Common causes: missing component, wrong repository URL, credential issues.

### RBAC Permission Errors

If the controller logs show permission errors like `forbidden` or `cannot create resource`, the controller lacks RBAC permissions to manage `ResourceGraphDefinitions`. Follow the [Custom RBAC guide]({{< relref "custom-rbac.md" >}}) to grant the necessary permissions.

### Instance Not Syncing

If the Bootstrap instance stays in a non-ACTIVE state:

```bash
kubectl describe bootstrap bootstrap
```

Check the Events section for error messages.

### ImagePullBackOff Errors

If pods show `ImagePullBackOff` or `ErrImagePull` errors, the kubelet cannot pull the localized image from your private registry. Add `imagePullSecrets` to the HelmRelease values as described in the "Configure credentials for private registries" section.

## What You Learned

You've successfully:

- Created an OCM component with embedded deployment instructions (RGD)
- Used `--copy-resources --upload-as ociArtifact` to enable localization during transfer
- Deployed the component using the bootstrap pattern
- Verified that localization kept image references in sync

This pattern allows developers to ship deployment instructions alongside their software, while operators only need to create simple bootstrap resources.
