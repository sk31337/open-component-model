A component version describes a set of resources (container images, Helm charts, configuration files) but it does not
necessarily store those resources itself. Resource repositories are the abstraction OCM uses to upload, download, and
authenticate against the actual storage backends where resource artifacts live.

## Why Separate Resource Storage?

Component versions are stored in a component version repository (typically an OCI registry). Each component version
contains a descriptor listing its resources, but the resources themselves may live somewhere else entirely: a different
OCI registry, a Helm chart repository, or a cloud storage bucket.

This separation exists for practical reasons:

- **Resources predate component versions.** A container image often exists in a registry long before anyone wraps it in
  a component version. OCM needs to reference it where it already lives rather than requiring a copy.
- **Different storage, different protocols.** OCI images use the OCI distribution spec. Helm charts use HTTP index-based
  repositories or OCI. Future resource types may use entirely different protocols. A single abstraction cannot hide
  these differences, so each needs its own implementation.
- **Credentials differ per backend.** Accessing an OCI registry requires OCI credentials. Accessing a Helm repository
  requires Helm-style credentials. Resource repositories resolve the correct
  [credential consumer identity]({{< relref "docs/reference/credential-consumer-identities.md" >}}) for each backend,
  integrating with OCM's [credential system]({{< relref "docs/concepts/credential-system.md" >}}).

## How It Works

Every resource in a component descriptor carries an **access specification** with a `type` field (e.g., `OCIImage/v1`,
`Helm/v1`). When OCM needs to download or upload a resource, it uses the access type to look up the matching resource
repository in a plugin registry.

Each resource repository implements three operations:

1. **Resolve credential identity**: determine what credentials are needed to access the resource.
2. **Download**: fetch the resource content as a blob.
3. **Upload**: push resource content to the backend (not all backends support this).

OCM ships with a set of built-in resource repositories, and that set grows as new access types are added. For the
current list, including the access types each one supports, its credential resolution rules, and its capabilities, see
the [Resource Repositories Reference]({{< relref "docs/reference/resource-repositories.md" >}}).

## Extensibility Through Plugins

Resource repositories are extensible through the [plugin system]({{< relref "docs/concepts/plugin-system.md" >}}). An
external plugin can add support for new access types without modifying OCM itself. The plugin declares which access
types it supports, and OCM routes requests to it automatically.

This means organizations can support proprietary artifact stores, custom download protocols, or specialized
authentication flows by implementing a resource repository plugin.

## How Resource Repositories Fit Into Transfer

During [transfer]({{< relref "docs/concepts/transfer-concept.md" >}}), resource repositories play a central role. When
transferring with a local blob uploader configuration, OCM uses the source resource repository to download each resource artifact and the
target resource repository to upload it. This is how a container image moves from one OCI registry to another or how a
Helm chart gets re-hosted into a target environment.

Without resource repositories, transfer would only be able to copy component descriptors (metadata). Resource
repositories make self-contained, air-gappable transfers possible.
