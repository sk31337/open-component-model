The OCM controllers reconcile OCM component versions into a Kubernetes cluster. They form a chain of four custom resources, each depending on the previous one becoming `Ready`:

- **Repository** validates that an OCM repository is reachable.
- **Component** resolves and verifies a component version from that repository.
- **Resource** fetches a specific resource from the component version.
- **[Deployer]({{< relref "kubernetes-deployer.md" >}})** downloads the resource content and applies it to the cluster.

A fifth resource, **Replication**, sits alongside the chain rather than within it. Instead of delivering content into the cluster, it transfers a resolved component version from one OCM repository to another, mirroring `ocm transfer` as a controller.

A sixth resource, **Discovery**, also sits alongside the chain. It publishes a filtered, optionally projected view of a `Component`'s transitive reference graph without downloading artifacts or applying anything to the cluster.

## Architecture

The OCM controllers act as a bridge between an OCM repository and a Kubernetes cluster. Rather than pulling manifests from a Git repository or a plain OCI image, they consume structured OCM component versions — complete with provenance, signatures, and access metadata — and translate them into running workloads.

This separation means that the same component version can be deployed to multiple clusters, across air-gapped environments, or with different credential configurations, without changing what was published. The controllers handle resolution, verification, and delivery. The component author controls what gets shipped and how it is signed.

## The Reconciliation Chain

Each custom resource in the chain depends on the previous one being `Ready`. A child object declares a reference to its parent by name, and will not proceed until the parent has been successfully reconciled. This gives each step a clear responsibility and a clear failure surface.

    Repository -->|referenced by| Component
    Component  -->|referenced by| Resource
    Resource   -->|referenced by| Deployer

    class Repository,Component,Resource,Deployer crd
```

### Repository

A `Repository` validates that a given OCM repository is reachable and healthy. It is the entry point for the entire chain — without a `Ready` repository, nothing downstream can proceed. You configure it with the registry base URL and type, plus any credentials needed to reach it.

[API reference]({{< relref "/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/repository.md" >}})

### Component

A `Component` tracks a specific OCM component within a repository. You give it a component name and a semver constraint, and it continuously resolves the highest matching version. Once resolved, the controller verifies the component descriptor and optionally checks cryptographic signatures. The resolved version and digest are published in its status for downstream objects to consume.

You can control whether the controller is allowed to move to a lower version if the constraint is relaxed (`downgradePolicy`), and narrow the candidate set further with a regex filter on version strings.

[API reference]({{< relref "/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/component.md" >}})

### Resource

A `Resource` selects a specific artifact from within a resolved component version. You identify the artifact by name (and optionally by a path through nested component references). Once the parent `Component` is `Ready`, the controller fetches the resource descriptor — access information, digest, type, labels — and stores it in its status.

You can attach CEL expressions via `additionalStatusFields` to extract values from the descriptor and surface them in `status.additional`. This is useful when downstream tools like [Kro](https://kro.run/) need to wire specific values — such as an image reference or chart version — into their own resources without parsing the full descriptor themselves.

[API reference]({{< relref "/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/resource.md" >}})

### Deployer

A `Deployer` is a cluster-scoped object that watches a `Resource` and, once it is `Ready`, downloads the resource blob and applies the contained Kubernetes manifests to the cluster using server-side apply. It manages the full lifecycle of what it deploys: *creating* resources on first apply, *updating* them when the component version changes, and *pruning* resources that are no longer part of the manifest set.

See [Kubernetes Deployer]({{< relref "kubernetes-deployer.md" >}}) for a full description of its apply semantics, drift detection, and caching behavior.

[API reference]({{< relref "/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/deployer.md" >}})

## Replication

A `Replication` references a `Component` for its source and a `Repository` for its target. It watches the source
`Component`'s status and, whenever the resolved version changes, transfers that version, together with the full
graph of components it references (if recursion is enabled), into the target repository. It is the controller
equivalent of `ocm transfer`, and fits delivery pipelines, promotion between environments, and backup or air-gap
scenarios where a management cluster mirrors content into a downstream registry.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    classDef crd fill:#e8f4fd,stroke:#2c7be5,color:#1a1a2e
    classDef ext fill:#f5f5f5,stroke:#888,color:#1a1a2e

    Source["Repository\n(source)"]
    Component["Component"]
    Target["Repository\n(target)"]
    Replication["Replication"]

    Source -->|referenced by| Component
    Component -->|source version| Replication
    Target -->|target| Replication
    Replication -->|transfers to| TargetReg[("Target OCM\nrepository")]

    class Source,Component,Target,Replication crd
    class TargetReg ext
```

A few more things about replication:

- The transferred version is the one recorded in the source `Component`'s *status*, meaning a version that has already been successfully reconciled (and verified, if verification is configured). It does not re-evaluate the `Component`'s semver constraint itself.
- A successful transfer records the source digest in `status.lastTransferredDigest`. A reconciliation observing the same digest is a no-op, so re-applying or requeueing does not re-transfer unchanged content.
- First, it walks the component's reference graph through the [resolution worker pool](#asynchronous-component-resolution), reporting `ResolutionInProgress` until every referenced descriptor is available. Then, it executes the transfer, reporting `TransferInProgress` until completion. Per-transformation failures are recorded in `status.lastFailedTransferEvents` and cleared on the next success.
- Recursion depth, copy mode, upload type, and the credentials for the target registry are supplied as OCM configuration referenced from `spec.ocmConfig` (a `Secret` or a `ConfigMap` object carrying a `transfer.config.ocm.software` entry). See [Replicate Component Versions with the Controller]({{< relref "docs/how-to/replicate-component-versions-controller.md" >}}) for a concrete example.

[API reference]({{< relref "/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/replication.md" >}})

## Discovery

A `Discovery` publishes a filtered, optionally projected view of the transitive reference graph of a `Component`. It is a read-only, query-style resource: it downloads no artifacts, creates no external resources, and provides no signature-verification guarantees for the descriptors it filters.

See [Kubernetes Component Discovery]({{< relref "/docs/concepts/component-discovery.md" >}}) for a full description and its querying behaviour.

[API reference]({{< relref "/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/discovery.md" >}})

## Asynchronous Component Resolution

Component version resolution happens in a background worker pool. When a controller needs a component version, it submits a request and receives a sentinel error (`ErrResolutionInProgress`). The controller returns early without blocking. Once the worker finishes, it broadcasts an event that re-triggers reconciliation for all waiting objects.

Requests for the same component version are deduplicated across multiple subscribers.

## Configuration Propagation

OCM configuration such as credentials and resolvers flows through the reconciliation chain. Each object can declare its own config references and inherit configs from its parent:

```yaml
spec:
  ocmConfig:
    - kind: Secret
      name: registry-credentials
      policy: Propagate
```

`Propagate` makes the config available to child objects in the chain. `DoNotPropagate` scopes it to that object only. Supported sources are Kubernetes `Secrets`, `ConfigMaps`, and `OCMConfiguration` objects.

Configuration is request-scoped and loaded and applied per reconciliation, so changing a referenced `Secret` or `ConfigMap` takes effect on the next reconcile without restarting the controller.

The controller accepts a fixed set of OCM configuration types and silently drops the rest:

| Type                              | Purpose                                                                                                                        |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `credentials.config.ocm.software` | registry credentials                                                                                                           |
| `ocm.config.ocm.software`         | resolvers (the deprecated `aliases` field is ignored)                                                                          |
| `resolvers.config.ocm.software`   | path-matcher resolvers                                                                                                         |
| `transfer.config.ocm.software`    | replication settings                                                                                                           |
| `http.config.ocm.software`        | HTTP client timeouts, retries, per-host overrides, and `insecureSkipVerify` for local registries with self-signed certificates |

`filesystem.config.ocm.software` is deliberately **not** accepted.

## Additional Status Fields

The `Resource` object supports `additionalStatusFields`, a map of field names to [CEL](https://github.com/google/cel-spec) expressions evaluated against the resource descriptor:

```yaml
spec:
  additionalStatusFields:
    registry: "resource.access.toOCI().registry"
```

Results are stored under `status.additional.<fieldName>` and can be consumed by downstream tools like [Kro](https://kro.run/) to wire values between resources in a `ResourceGraphDefinition`.

## Installation

See [Install the OCM Controllers]({{< relref "setup-controller-environment.md#install-the-ocm-controllers" >}}) for a step-by-step guide including prerequisites and verification.

{{<callout context="caution" title="Deployer tools" icon="outline/alert-triangle">}}
While the OCM controllers technically can be used standalone, it requires kro and a deployer, e.g. Flux or Argo CD, to deploy
an OCM resource into a Kubernetes cluster. The OCM controllers deployment, however, does not contain kro or any
deployer. Please refer to the respective installation guides for these tools:

- [kro](https://kro.run/docs/getting-started/Installation/)
- [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/docs/installation/)
- [Argo CD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/installation/)
