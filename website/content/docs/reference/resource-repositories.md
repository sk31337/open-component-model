## OCI Resource Repository

Handles OCI artifacts stored in OCI-compliant registries.

### Supported Access Types

| Access Type                                                            |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [`OCIImage/v1`]({{< relref "input-and-access-types.md" >}}#ociimagev1) |

### Capabilities

| Operation         | Supported |
|-------------------|-----------|
| Download          | Yes       |
| Upload            | Yes       |
| Digest Processing | Yes       |

### Credential Resolution

The credential consumer identity is derived from the `imageReference` field in the access specification. The registry
hostname is extracted from the image reference to construct an identity of type `OCIRegistry`.

**Example:** For a resource with access `imageReference: ghcr.io/acme/myapp:1.0.0`, the resolved identity is:

| Attribute  | Value         |
|------------|---------------|
| `type`     | `OCIRegistry` |
| `hostname` | `ghcr.io`     |
| `scheme`   | `https`       |

This identity is then matched against configured consumers in the credential system.
See [Credential Consumer Identities: OCIRegistry]({{< relref "credential-consumer-identities.md" >}}#ociregistry) for
matching rules.

### Download Behavior

Downloads the complete OCI artifact (manifest and layers) from the registry. The returned blob represents the artifact
in its OCI format.

### Upload Behavior

Pushes an OCI artifact to the target registry. The resource descriptor is updated with the repository-specific access
information (e.g., the final image reference with digest) after upload.

### Digest Processing

The OCI resource repository also implements digest processing. When constructing a component version with a by-reference
resource, OCM queries the registry to resolve and verify the artifact's digest, ensuring the resource descriptor is
pinned to an immutable reference.

---

## Helm Resource Repository

Handles Helm charts stored in HTTP/HTTPS-based chart repositories.

### Supported Access Types

| Access Type                                                    |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| [`Helm/v1`]({{< relref "input-and-access-types.md" >}}#helmv1) |

### Capabilities

| Operation         | Supported |
|-------------------|-----------|
| Download          | Yes       |
| Upload            | No        |
| Digest Processing | Yes       |

{{< callout context="note" >}}
Upload is not supported because traditional Helm chart repositories are read-only HTTP servers that serve a static
`index.yaml` and packaged chart archives. There is no standardized upload API.

For Helm charts stored in OCI registries, use the [OCI resource repository](#oci-resource-repository) with an [
`OCIImage/v1`]({{< relref "input-and-access-types.md" >}}#ociimagev1) access type instead.
{{< /callout >}}

### Credential Resolution

The credential consumer identity is derived from the `helmRepository` field in the access specification. The identity
type is `HelmChartRepository`.

**Example:** For a resource with `helmRepository: https://stefanprodan.github.io/podinfo`:

| Attribute  | Value                    |
|------------|--------------------------|
| `type`     | `HelmChartRepository`    |
| `hostname` | `stefanprodan.github.io` |
| `scheme`   | `https`                  |
| `path`     | `podinfo`                |

If the resource has no `helmRepository` (a local chart embedded via input), no credential identity is returned — local
charts do not require remote authentication.

See
[Credential Consumer Identities: HelmChartRepository]
({{< relref "credential-consumer-identities.md" >}}#helmchartrepository)
for matching rules.

### Download Behavior

Downloads the Helm chart (and optional `.prov` provenance file) from the remote repository. The chart is packaged into a
tar archive and returned as an in-memory blob.

The `helmChart` and `helmRepository` fields from the access specification are combined to construct the full chart
reference used for download.

### Digest Processing

The Helm digest processor resolves chart digests from the remote repository. For HTTP/HTTPS repositories it downloads
the `index.yaml` and extracts the digest for the specified chart and version. For OCI-based Helm repositories it
resolves the OCI manifest digest via the registry API.

---

## Wget Resource Repository

Handles resources served over plain HTTP or HTTPS.

### Supported Access Types

| Access Type                                                                                                                                             |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [`Wget/v1`]({{< relref "input-and-access-types.md" >}}#wgetv1-access), also accepted as `HTTP/v1`, `HTTP`, `http/v1`, `http`, `wget/v1`, `Wget`, `wget` |

### Capabilities

| Operation         | Supported |
|-------------------|-----------|
| Download          | Yes       |
| Upload            | No        |
| Digest Processing | Yes       |

{{< callout context="note" >}}
Upload is not supported because a plain HTTP endpoint has no standardized write API. The transfer downloads the content
and stores it as a [`LocalBlob/v1`]({{< relref "input-and-access-types.md" >}}#localblobv1) in the target repository, regardless of the requested upload type.
{{< /callout >}}

### Credential Resolution

The credential consumer identity is derived from the `url` field in the access specification. The identity type is
`Wget`, and stays `Wget` even when the access is declared under one of the `HTTP` aliases.

**Example:** For a resource with `url: https://downloads.example.com/myapp/1.0.0/myapp.tar.gz`:

| Attribute  | Value                      |
|------------|----------------------------|
| `type`     | `Wget`                     |
| `hostname` | `downloads.example.com`    |
| `scheme`   | `https`                    |
| `path`     | `myapp/1.0.0/myapp.tar.gz` |

The [`Wget/v1` input type]({{< relref "input-and-access-types.md" >}}#wgetv1-input) derives the identity the same way,
so one consumer entry covers construction and later downloads.

See [Credential Consumer Identities: Wget / HTTP]({{< relref "credential-consumer-identities.md" >}}#wget--http) for matching rules and the accepted aliases for the consumer identity type.

### Download Behavior

Performs the request described by the access specification (`verb`, `header`, `body`, `noRedirect`) and returns the
response body as a file-backed blob. Only 2xx responses are accepted. The body is streamed to a file under the
`tempFolder` of the `filesystem.config.ocm.software/v1alpha1` configuration type rather than buffered in memory, and
there is no size limit by default. The media type of the blob is taken from `mediaType`, falling back to the response
`Content-Type` and then to `application/octet-stream`.

Request timeouts, retries, and per-host settings come from the
[HTTP client configuration]({{< relref "http-client-configuration.md" >}}).

### Digest Processing

The Wget digest processor downloads the referenced content and hashes it with SHA-256, using the
`genericBlobDigest/v1` normalisation. When the resource already carries a digest, the computed value is verified against
it and a mismatch fails the operation. Because the digest is computed over the fetched bytes, a URL whose content
changes will not verify against a previously recorded digest.

A resource can carry a digest before it has ever been fetched: setting the optional `digest` field on the resource in
`component-constructor.yaml` turns the recorded value into an assertion, so `ocm add cv` fails rather than recording
whatever the server returned. See
[Tutorial: Work with HTTP Resources]({{< relref "docs/tutorials/wget-http-resources.md#pin-a-digest" >}}).

## S3 Resource Repository

Handles resources stored as a single object in an S3 or S3-compatible bucket (AWS S3, MinIO, Ceph RGW, Cloudflare R2).

### Supported Access Types

| Access Type                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [`S3/v2`]({{< relref "input-and-access-types.md" >}}#s3v2-access)             |

### Capabilities

| Operation         | Supported |
|-------------------|-----------|
| Download          | Yes       |
| Upload            | No        |
| Digest Processing | Yes       |

{{< callout context="note" >}}
The repository supports download only, the same as OCM v1. OCM never writes an object into a bucket, so an upload
never creates an `S3/v2` access specification.
{{< /callout >}}

### Credential Resolution

OCM derives the credential consumer identity from `bucketName`, `objectKey` and the optional `endpoint` of the access
specification. The identity type is `S3`.

**Example:** A resource sets `bucketName: acme-artifacts` and
`objectKey: datasets/reference/1.0.0/reference.parquet`, and sets no `endpoint`:

| Attribute | Value                                                       |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `type`    | `S3`                                                        |
| `path`    | `acme-artifacts/datasets/reference/1.0.0/reference.parquet` |

An `endpoint` adds its `scheme`, `hostname` and `port`. AWS S3 adds no hostname, because it is the default target. The
[`S3/v2` input type]({{< relref "input-and-access-types.md" >}}#s3v2-input) derives the identity the same
way, so one consumer entry covers the construction and the later downloads.

Credentials are optional. If no consumer entry matches, the AWS default credential chain applies: environment
variables, the shared AWS config, and IAM instance or task roles.

See [Credential Consumer Identities: S3]({{< relref "credential-consumer-identities.md" >}}#s3) for matching
rules.

### Download Behavior

Sends a `GetObject` request for the bucket and the key of the access specification. If `version` is set, the request
reads that version. OCM streams the body to a file under the `tempFolder` of the
`filesystem.config.ocm.software/v1alpha1` configuration type. It does not hold the body in memory, and there is no size
limit by default. The media type of the blob comes from `mediaType`. If `mediaType` is empty, OCM uses the
`Content-Type` of the object, and then `application/octet-stream`.

Requests go through the shared OCM HTTP client, so timeouts, TLS settings and per-host overrides come from the
[HTTP client configuration]({{< relref "http-client-configuration.md" >}}). The AWS SDK does the retries. It retries
the whole operation and signs each attempt again. The configured `retry.maxRetries` sets its attempt count. The SDK
resolves the request host for AWS, so a per-host retry entry takes effect only for a custom `endpoint`. For AWS, the
global setting applies.

### Digest Processing

The S3 digest processor downloads the object and hashes it with SHA-256. It applies the `genericBlobDigest/v1`
normalisation. It does not use the S3 `ETag`, because the `ETag` is not a whole-object hash for a multipart upload. If
the resource already has a digest, OCM compares the computed digest with it. A difference fails the operation.

Digest processing also pins the access specification to the object version that it read, so a later read gets the same
object. On an unversioned bucket, S3 reports the placeholder `null`. It pins nothing, and OCM never writes it back.
See
[Input and Access Types: Object versions and integrity]({{< relref "input-and-access-types.md" >}}#object-versions-and-integrity).

## GitHub Resource Repository

Handles source archives of a pinned commit in a GitHub (or GitHub Enterprise) repository.

### Supported Access Types

| Access Type                                                        |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [`GitHub/v1`]({{< relref "input-and-access-types.md" >}}#githubv1) |

### Capabilities

| Operation         | Supported |
|-------------------|-----------|
| Download          | Yes       |
| Upload            | No        |
| Digest Processing | Yes       |

{{< callout context="note" >}}
Upload is not supported: the `GitHub/v1` access type is a read-only source reference. Content is pushed to GitHub
through git, not through OCM.
{{< /callout >}}

### Credential Resolution

The credential consumer identity is derived from the `repoUrl` field in the access specification. The identity type is
`GitHubRepository`.

**Example:** For a resource with `repoUrl: https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm`:

| Attribute  | Value                       |
|------------|-----------------------------|
| `type`     | `GitHubRepository`          |
| `hostname` | `github.com`                |
| `scheme`   | `https`                     |
| `path`     | `open-component-model/ocm`  |

The identity is derived from `repoUrl` on GitHub Enterprise hosts too. Credentials are optional: without them requests
are anonymous, subject to GitHub's per-IP rate limit, and private repositories answer 404. When credentials resolve,
their `token` property (a GitHub or GitHub Enterprise access token) authenticates against the GitHub REST API.

{{< callout context="caution" >}}
`apiHostname` does not change the consumer identity. When the REST API lives on a host other than the repository, the
identity still carries the `repoUrl` host, so configure the consumer for that host rather than for `apiHostname`. The
resolved token is then sent to the `apiHostname` host.
{{< /callout >}}

See [Credential Consumer Identities: GitHubRepository]({{< relref "credential-consumer-identities.md" >}}#githubrepository)
for matching rules.

### Download Behavior

Downloads the source archive of the commit pinned in the access via the GitHub REST API. The archive is returned as an
in-memory gzipped tar blob.

### Digest Processing

If the access has only a `ref`, the GitHub digest processor resolves it to a `commit` and writes that commit onto the
resource. This works like an OCI tag that is pinned to a digest. It then downloads the archive at that commit and
hashes it: `SHA-256` over the archive bytes, normalisation `genericBlobDigest/v1`.
If the access already has a `commit`, the ref is not resolved again. A branch can move on, or be deleted after a merge,
and that must not break a component version that has not changed.

The digest is checked on both paths. If the resource already declares one, the computed value must match it. The hash
and normalisation algorithms are only compared when they are set: an empty field is filled in with the computed value.

---

## Git Resource Repository

Handles snapshots of a commit in any Git repository, fetched over HTTPS, HTTP, SSH, the Git protocol or from a local
path.

### Supported Access Types

| Access Type                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [`Git/v1`]({{< relref "input-and-access-types.md" >}}#gitv1-access)           |

The [`Git/v1` input type]({{< relref "input-and-access-types.md" >}}#gitv1-input) uses the same download, archive
format and credentials.

### Capabilities

| Operation         | Supported |
|-------------------|-----------|
| Download          | Yes       |
| Upload            | No        |
| Digest Processing | Yes       |

{{< callout context="note" >}}
Upload is not supported: the `Git/v1` access type is a read-only source reference. A commit is pushed with Git, not
with OCM.
{{< /callout >}}

### Credential Resolution

The credential consumer identity is derived from the `repository` field in the access specification. The identity type
is `Git`.

**Example:** For a resource with `repository: https://gitlab.com/example-group/example-project.git`:

| Attribute  | Value                                |
|------------|--------------------------------------|
| `type`     | `Git`                                |
| `scheme`   | `https`                              |
| `hostname` | `gitlab.com`                         |
| `port`     | `443`                                |
| `path`     | `example-group/example-project.git`  |

Credentials are optional. Without them, HTTPS requests are anonymous, and SSH uses the SSH agent. When credentials
resolve, OCM uses an SSH private key first, then a token, then a username and password. See
[`GitCredentials/v1`]({{< relref "credential-types.md#gitcredentialsv1" >}}).

See [Credential Consumer Identities: Git]({{< relref "credential-consumer-identities.md" >}}#git) for how each URL form
maps to the identity, and for matching rules.

### Download Behavior

OCM fetches the pinned commit into a temporary bare repository. If the server does not allow a fetch by commit SHA, OCM
fetches all refs instead. With only a `ref`, OCM fetches all refs and resolves the `ref` to a commit. An annotated tag
is resolved to the commit it points to. `ref: HEAD` without a `commit` is the one case where OCM clones the whole
repository, with all refs and tags, instead of fetching.

OCM then writes the files of the commit into a gzip-compressed tar (`application/x-tgz`). It reads the Git objects
directly, so no working tree is checked out. The archive is deterministic:

- Entries are sorted by path, depth first, without a root directory.
- Owner and group are `0`, and all modification times are the Unix epoch.
- Files have mode `0644`, executable files and directories `0755`, and symbolic links `0777`.
- Symbolic links are kept as links. Submodules are empty directories.

The same commit therefore gives the same archive bytes with the same OCM version. A different Go version in a later
OCM release may compress differently.

The archive is streamed to a file under the `tempFolder` of the `filesystem.config.ocm.software/v1alpha1`
configuration type. When `tempFolder` is unset, OCM uses the temporary directory of the operating system. The temporary
Git storage is removed after the download.

### Digest Processing

If the access has only a `ref`, the Git digest processor resolves it to a `commit` and writes that commit onto the
resource. This works like an OCI tag that is pinned to a digest. The `ref` stays in the access, but only as
information. The processor hashes the archive of that commit in the same download: `SHA-256` over the compressed
archive bytes, normalisation `genericBlobDigest/v1`.

If the access already has a `commit`, the `ref` is not resolved again. A branch can move on, or be deleted after a
merge, and that must not break a component version that has not changed.

The digest is checked on every download. If the resource already declares one, the computed value must match it. The
hash and normalisation algorithms are only compared when they are set: an empty field is filled in with the computed
value.

## External Resource Repositories (Plugins)

External plugins declare supported access types in their capability specification and implement the same three
operations (resolve credential identity, download, upload) over the plugin protocol. Once installed, OCM routes requests
for matching access types to the plugin automatically.

See [Concept: Plugin System]({{< relref "docs/concepts/plugin-system.md" >}}) for details on building and installing
plugins.
