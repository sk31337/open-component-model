This page is the technical reference for OCM's built-in credential types — the values you place in the `credentials:` field of a consumer entry. For a high-level introduction, see [Credential System]({{< relref "docs/concepts/credential-system.md" >}}).

## Overview

Every consumer entry in `.ocmconfig` has a `credentials:` list. Each entry in that list has a `type` that determines
which fields are expected:

```yaml
consumers:
  - identity:
      type: OCIRegistry
      hostname: registry.example.com
    credentials:
      - type: <credential-type>
        # ... type-specific fields
```

OCM ships with the following built-in credential types:

| Credential Type                                            | Used With                                | Purpose                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`OCICredentials/v1`](#ocicredentialsv1)                   | `OCIRegistry` consumers                  | OCI registry username/password and token auth                   |
| [`HelmHTTPCredentials/v1`](#helmhttpcredentialsv1)         | `HelmChartRepository` consumers (HTTP/S) | Helm HTTP repository auth and TLS client certs                  |
| [`WgetCredentials/v1`](#wgetcredentialsv1)                 | `Wget` consumers                         | HTTP/S Basic Auth, bearer token, and mutual TLS                 |
| [`S3Credentials/v1`](#s3credentialsv1)                     | `S3` consumers                           | S3 access keys and temporary STS credentials                    |
| [`GitHubCredentials/v1`](#githubcredentialsv1)             | `GitHubRepository` consumers             | GitHub and GitHub Enterprise REST API token auth                |
| [`GitCredentials/v1`](#gitcredentialsv1)                   | `Git` consumers                          | Git over HTTPS (token, Basic Auth) and SSH keys                 |
| [`RSACredentials/v1`](#rsacredentialsv1)                   | `RSA/v1alpha1` consumers                 | RSA signing and verification key material                       |
| [`GPGCredentials/v1alpha1`](#gpgcredentialsv1alpha1)       | `GPG/v1alpha1` consumers                 | GPG signing and verification key material                       |
| [`OIDCIdentityToken/v1alpha1`](#oidcidentitytokenv1alpha1) | `SigstoreSigner/v1alpha1` consumers      | OIDC token for Sigstore keyless signing via Fulcio              |
| [`TrustedRoot/v1alpha1`](#trustedrootv1alpha1)             | `SigstoreVerifier/v1alpha1` consumers    | Sigstore trust material for private infrastructure verification |
| [`DirectCredentials/v1`](#directcredentialsv1)             | Any consumer                             | Legacy untyped key-value fallback (also `Credentials/v1`)       |

All typed credential types use flat top-level fields. `DirectCredentials/v1` uses a nested `properties:` map — it is the
universal fallback and all existing `.ocmconfig` files using `Credentials/v1` continue to work unchanged.

---

## Discovering Credential Types

The `ocm describe types` command exposes the full set of credential types registered in your OCM installation, including
any types introduced by installed plugins.

**List all available credential types:**

```bash
ocm describe types credentials
```

**Inspect the fields of a specific credential type:**

```bash
ocm describe types credentials OCICredentials/v1
```

**Export the raw JSON Schema for a type** (useful for tooling and validation):

```bash
ocm describe types credentials OCICredentials/v1 -o jsonschema
```

---

## OCICredentials/v1

{{< schema-renderer url="/schemas/bindings/go/credentials/oci/v1/OCICredentials.schema.json" >}}

### Example

```yaml
consumers:
  - identity:
      type: OCIRegistry
      hostname: registry.example.com
    credentials:
      - type: OCICredentials/v1
        username: my-user
        password: my-password
```

Token-based authentication:

```yaml
consumers:
  - identity:
      type: OCIRegistry
      hostname: registry.example.com
    credentials:
      - type: OCICredentials/v1
        refreshToken: my-oauth2-refresh-token
```

### Used With

[`OCIRegistry`]({{< relref "credential-consumer-identities.md#ociregistry" >}}) consumer identities. For OCI-backed Helm
repositories, also use `OCICredentials/v1` (not `HelmHTTPCredentials/v1`).

---

## HelmHTTPCredentials/v1

{{< schema-renderer url="/schemas/bindings/go/credentials/helm/v1/HelmHTTPCredentials.schema.json" >}}

### Example

Username/password:

```yaml
consumers:
  - identity:
      type: HelmChartRepository
      hostname: charts.example.com
      scheme: https
    credentials:
      - type: HelmHTTPCredentials/v1
        username: helm-user
        password: helm-password
```

Mutual TLS:

```yaml
consumers:
  - identity:
      type: HelmChartRepository
      hostname: charts.internal
      scheme: https
    credentials:
      - type: HelmHTTPCredentials/v1
        certFile: /path/to/client.crt
        keyFile: /path/to/client.key
```

### Used With

[`HelmChartRepository`]({{< relref "credential-consumer-identities.md#helmchartrepository" >}}) consumer identities that
use HTTP/S transport. For OCI-based Helm repositories, use `OCICredentials/v1` instead.

---

## WgetCredentials/v1

{{< schema-renderer url="/schemas/bindings/go/credentials/wget/v1/WgetCredentials.schema.json" >}}

### Example

HTTP Basic Auth:

```yaml
consumers:
  - identity:
      type: Wget
      hostname: downloads.example.com
      scheme: https
    credentials:
      - type: WgetCredentials/v1
        username: my-user
        password: my-password
```

Bearer token:

```yaml
consumers:
  - identity:
      type: Wget
      hostname: api.example.com
      scheme: https
      path: artifacts/*
    credentials:
      - type: WgetCredentials/v1
        identityToken: eyJhbGciOi...
```

Mutual TLS with a private CA:

```yaml
consumers:
  - identity:
      type: Wget
      hostname: artifacts.internal
      scheme: https
    credentials:
      - type: WgetCredentials/v1
        certificate: |
          -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
          MIIDdzCCAl+gAwIBAgIEbGVnYWw...
          -----END CERTIFICATE-----
        privateKey: |
          -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
          MIIEvQIBADANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQ...
          -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
        certificateAuthority: |
          -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
          MIIDQTCCAimgAwIBAgITBmyf...
          -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

{{< callout context="note" >}}
`username`/`password` and `identityToken` both set the `Authorization` header and are mutually exclusive. When both are
present, the bearer token is used and a warning is logged. The mutual TLS pair (`certificate` + `privateKey`) is a
transport-layer credential and can be combined with either. `certificateAuthority` is only evaluated when `certificate`
is set, and a client certificate has no effect on a plain `http://` URL.
{{< /callout >}}

### Used With

[`Wget`]({{< relref "credential-consumer-identities.md#wget" >}}) consumer identities, covering both the
[`Wget/v1` access type]({{< relref "input-and-access-types.md#wgetv1-access" >}}) and the
[`Wget/v1` input type]({{< relref "input-and-access-types.md#wgetv1-input" >}}).

---

## S3Credentials/v1

{{< schema-renderer url="/schemas/bindings/go/credentials/s3/v1/S3Credentials.schema.json" >}}

Authentication fields are optional. `anonymous` is an optional boolean that defaults to `false`. When false or
omitted, an entry with no access key, secret or session token uses the AWS default credential chain (environment,
shared config and IAM roles). If any key or token field is set, OCM passes those static credentials to the AWS SDK.
Incomplete or invalid credentials do not fall back to the default chain.

Set `anonymous: true` to read public objects without signing, even when AWS credentials are available. It cannot
be combined with `accessKeyId`, `secretAccessKey` or `sessionToken`, including their legacy aliases during conversion.
Missing credentials and credential-provider or S3 authorization errors never trigger anonymous access.
Authentication settings belong only in credentials, never in an access or input specification.

### Example

Explicit anonymous access to a public object:

```yaml
consumers:
  - identity:
      type: S3
      path: public-bucket/path/to/object
    credentials:
      - type: S3Credentials/v1
        anonymous: true
```

Static access keys for every bucket the account owns (`anonymous: false` is optional):

```yaml
consumers:
  - identity:
      type: S3
    credentials:
      - type: S3Credentials/v1
        anonymous: false
        accessKeyId: <access-key-id>
        secretAccessKey: <secret-access-key>
```

Temporary STS credentials, scoped to one object:

```yaml
consumers:
  - identity:
      type: S3
      path: acme-artifacts/datasets/reference/1.0.0/reference.parquet
    credentials:
      - type: S3Credentials/v1
        accessKeyId: <temporary-access-key-id>
        secretAccessKey: <temporary-secret-access-key>
        sessionToken: <session-token>
```

A self-hosted MinIO, addressed by its endpoint:

```yaml
consumers:
  - identity:
      type: S3
      scheme: https
      hostname: minio.internal
      port: "9000"
    credentials:
      - type: S3Credentials/v1
        accessKeyId: minio-user
        secretAccessKey: minio-password
```

{{< callout context="note" >}}
OCM still accepts the OCM v1 property names `awsAccessKeyID`, `awsSecretAccessKey` and `token`, but only in an untyped
[`Credentials/v1`](#directcredentialsv1) entry. There, OCM maps them to `accessKeyId`, `secretAccessKey` and
`sessionToken`. `S3Credentials/v1` accepts the new names only.
{{< /callout >}}

### Used With

[`S3`]({{< relref "credential-consumer-identities.md#s3" >}}) consumer identities. They cover both the
[S3 access types (v1, v2 and unversioned)]({{< relref "input-and-access-types.md#s3v2-access" >}}) and the
[`S3/v2` input type]({{< relref "input-and-access-types.md#s3v2-input" >}}).

---

## GitHubCredentials/v1

{{< schema-renderer url="/schemas/bindings/go/credentials/github/v1/GitHubCredentials.schema.json" >}}

### Example

```yaml
consumers:
  - identity:
      type: GitHubRepository
      hostname: github.com
    credentials:
      - type: GitHubCredentials/v1
        token: ghp_example_token
```

The legacy [`Credentials/v1`](#directcredentialsv1) fallback works as well, with `token` in its `properties` map:

```yaml
consumers:
  - identity:
      type: GitHubRepository
      hostname: github.com
    credentials:
      - type: Credentials/v1
        properties:
          token: ghp_example_token
```

Configuring no consumer at all is valid: the GitHub REST API is then called anonymously.

### Used With

[`GitHubRepository`]({{< relref "credential-consumer-identities.md#githubrepository" >}}) consumer identities.

---

## GitCredentials/v1

{{< schema-renderer url="/schemas/bindings/go/credentials/git/v1/GitCredentials.schema.json" >}}

OCM picks one authentication method, in this order:

1. **SSH key**: `privateKeyPEM` (inline PEM) or `privateKey` (path to a key file). `privateKeyPEM` wins when both are
   set. `password` is the key passphrase. `username` is the SSH user. If unset, OCM takes the user from the URL, or
   `git`. Needs an SSH repository URL.
2. **Token**: `token` is sent as an HTTP bearer token. Needs an HTTPS repository URL.
3. **Basic Auth**: `username` and `password`. Needs an HTTPS repository URL.

If your Git server does not accept bearer tokens, set `username` and put the token in `password`. OCM rejects a method
that does not fit the URL, for example a token for an SSH URL. It never sends credentials over plain HTTP.

### Example

HTTPS with a token as password:

```yaml
consumers:
  - identity:
      type: Git
      hostname: gitlab.com
      scheme: https
    credentials:
      - type: GitCredentials/v1
        username: oauth2
        password: glpat-example-token
```

SSH with a key file:

```yaml
consumers:
  - identity:
      type: Git
      hostname: git.example.com
      scheme: ssh
      port: "22"
    credentials:
      - type: GitCredentials/v1
        privateKey: /home/user/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

The legacy [`Credentials/v1`](#directcredentialsv1) fallback works as well, with the same property names in its
`properties` map. An OCM v1 configuration with `username`, `password`, `token` or `privateKey` therefore keeps working.

Configuring no consumer at all is valid: HTTPS requests are then anonymous, and SSH uses the SSH agent.

### Used With

[`Git`]({{< relref "credential-consumer-identities.md#git" >}}) consumer identities. They cover both the
[`Git/v1` access type]({{< relref "input-and-access-types.md#gitv1-access" >}}) and the
[`Git/v1` input type]({{< relref "input-and-access-types.md#gitv1-input" >}}).

---

## RSACredentials/v1

{{< schema-renderer url="/schemas/bindings/go/credentials/rsa/v1/RSACredentials.schema.json" >}}

### Example

File-based (recommended):

```yaml
consumers:
  - identity:
      type: RSA/v1alpha1
      algorithm: RSASSA-PSS
      signature: default
    credentials:
      - type: RSACredentials/v1
        privateKeyPEMFile: /path/to/private-key.pem
        publicKeyPEMFile: /path/to/public-key.pem
```

Inline keys:

```yaml
consumers:
  - identity:
      type: RSA/v1alpha1
      algorithm: RSASSA-PSS
      signature: default
    credentials:
      - type: RSACredentials/v1
        privateKeyPEM: |
          -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
          MIIEpAIBAAKCAQEA...
          -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
        publicKeyPEM: |
          -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
          MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8A...
          -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
```

### Used With

[`RSA/v1alpha1`]({{< relref "credential-consumer-identities.md#rsav1alpha1" >}}) consumer identities.

---

## GPGCredentials/v1alpha1

{{< schema-renderer url="/schemas/bindings/go/credentials/gpg/v1alpha1/GPGCredentials.schema.json" >}}

### Example

```yaml
consumers:
  - identity:
      type: GPG/v1alpha1
      algorithm: application/vnd.ocm.signature.gpg
      signature: default
    credentials:
      - type: GPGCredentials/v1alpha1
        privateKeyPGPFile: /path/to/private.asc
        publicKeyPGPFile: /path/to/public.asc
        passphrase: my-passphrase
```

### Used With

`GPG/v1alpha1` consumer identities (signing and verification with OpenPGP keys).

---

## OIDCIdentityToken/v1alpha1

{{< schema-renderer url="/schemas/bindings/go/credentials/sigstore/oidcidentitytoken/v1alpha1/OIDCIdentityToken.schema.json" >}}

### Example

```yaml
consumers:
  - identity:
      type: SigstoreSigner/v1alpha1
      signature: default
    credentials:
      - type: OIDCIdentityToken/v1alpha1
        tokenFile: /path/to/oidc-token
```

### Used With

`SigstoreSigner/v1alpha1` consumer identities (Sigstore keyless signing path only; not used during verification).

---

## TrustedRoot/v1alpha1

{{< schema-renderer url="/schemas/bindings/go/credentials/sigstore/trustedroot/v1alpha1/TrustedRoot.schema.json" >}}

### Example

```yaml
consumers:
  - identity:
      type: SigstoreVerifier/v1alpha1
      signature: default
    credentials:
      - type: TrustedRoot/v1alpha1
        trustedRootJSONFile: /path/to/trusted-root.json
```

### Used With

`SigstoreVerifier/v1alpha1` consumer identities (Sigstore verification path only; not used during signing).

---

## DirectCredentials/v1

{{< schema-renderer url="/schemas/bindings/go/credentials/direct/v1/DirectCredentials.schema.json" >}}

### Example

OCI registry with `Credentials/v1`:

```yaml
consumers:
  - identity:
      type: OCIRegistry
      hostname: registry.example.com
    credentials:
      - type: Credentials/v1
        properties:
          username: my-user
          password: my-password
```

RSA signing with `Credentials/v1`:

```yaml
consumers:
  - identity:
      type: RSA/v1alpha1
      algorithm: RSASSA-PSS
      signature: default
    credentials:
      - type: Credentials/v1
        properties:
          privateKeyPEMFile: /path/to/private-key.pem
          publicKeyPEMFile: /path/to/public-key.pem
```

{{< callout context="note" >}}
`DirectCredentials/v1` property keys use the same **camelCase** names as the corresponding typed credential fields (
e.g., `privateKeyPEMFile`, not `private_key_pem_file`). The RSA binding additionally accepts the old `snake_case` keys (
`private_key_pem_file`, `public_key_pem_file`) as a deprecated backward-compatibility fallback — all other bindings
require camelCase.
{{< /callout >}}

### When to use

Use `Credentials/v1` / `DirectCredentials/v1` when:

- Migrating from an existing configuration and you want no changes
- Working with consumer identity types that do not yet have a corresponding typed credential type

Use the typed alternatives (`OCICredentials/v1`, `HelmHTTPCredentials/v1`, `RSACredentials/v1`) for new configurations —
they provide field validation at configuration parse time and clearer field names.

## Plugin-Declared Types

Plugins can introduce additional credential types beyond the built-ins listed here. A plugin declares its custom types
in the `customCredentialTypes` field of its capability spec. Those types are registered at plugin discovery time and
available in `.ocmconfig` alongside the built-ins.

External plugin credential types use a reverse-domain prefix by convention (e.g.,
`com.hashicorp.vault.VaultCredentials/v1`). This prevents name collisions between independently developed plugins.

For details on how plugins declare and register credential types, see
[Plugin System]({{< relref "docs/concepts/plugin-system.md" >}}).
