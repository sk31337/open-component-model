`targetURL`, every `header` value and the `path` of the Artifactory and Nexus uploaders are
[CEL](https://cel.dev/) expressions — the same expression language the transfer
graph uses to resolve every other field. A CEL value **must be wrapped in `${…}`**,
matching how every other CEL field is written in the transfer graph. It is
evaluated against the source resource, exposed under the `resource` alias, and its
component, exposed under the `component` alias, and resolved by the transfer
runtime, so the produced plan is deterministic. CEL string concatenation (`+`),
conditionals (`cond ? a : b`), and comparisons are all available. Append any static
query string inside the expression. (A value with no `${…}` is a plain literal and
is used verbatim.)

The `component` alias exposes the component of the source component version, e.g.
`component.name`, `component.version` and `component.provider`. The `resource`
alias always exposes:

| Expression                               | Value                                                        |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `resource.name`                          | Resource name.                                               |
| `resource.version`                       | Resource version.                                            |
| `resource.type`                          | Resource type.                                               |
| `resource.extraIdentity.<key>`           | A value from the resource's extra identity.                  |
| `resource.labels`                        | The resource labels as a list of `{name, value}` objects.    |
| `resource.digest.value`                  | The source digest value, when the resource carries a digest. |
| `resource.digest.hashAlgorithm`          | The source digest hash algorithm (e.g. `SHA-256`).           |
| `resource.digest.normalisationAlgorithm` | The source digest normalisation algorithm.                   |

Every field of the **source access** is exposed dynamically under
`resource.access.<field>`, so the expression works with any access type — the
field names are exactly those of that access. For example:

| Source access | Available under `resource.access` |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|
| `Wget/v1`     | `url`, `mediaType`                |
| `OCIImage/v1` | `imageReference`                  |
| `S3/v1`       | `bucket`, `key`, `region`, …      |

To decompose a URL-bearing access into its parts, use the inbuilt `url()` CEL
function (CEL has no URL parser). `url(<string>)` (also callable as
`<string>.url()`) parses a URL string and returns a map with the string keys
`scheme`, `host`, `hostname`, `port`, `path`, `rawPath`, `rawQuery`, `fragment`,
and `user`. For a `Wget/v1` source, `url(resource.access.url).path` yields the
path of the source URL. Because the field set is derived from the matched resource's
own access, an expression may only reference fields that exist on every resource
the uploader matches — scope the rule with `match.accessType` so all matched
resources share a shape.

Further inbuilt functions help build checksum headers:
`contentDigestAlgorithm(<string>)` maps an OCM digest algorithm name to its RFC 9530
`Content-Digest`/`Repr-Digest` key (`SHA-256` → `sha-256`); `hex.decode`/`hex.encode`
and the CEL encoders extension's `base64.encode`/`base64.decode` convert a hex digest
to the base64 value those fields expect. See [Templating Headers]({{< relref "docs/reference/transfer-configuration/http-uploader.md" >}}#templating-headers).

Examples:

```yaml
Preserve the source path under a new host
targetURL: '${"https://mytarget.example.com" + url(resource.access.url).path}'

Route by name and version
targetURL: '${"https://cdn.example.com/" + resource.name + "/" + resource.version + "/blob"}'

Use extra identity attributes
targetURL: '${"https://" + resource.extraIdentity.region + ".example.com/" + resource.extraIdentity.arch + url(resource.access.url).path}'

Conditional target driven by an extra-identity attribute
targetURL: '${resource.extraIdentity.tier == "public" ? "https://cdn.example.com" + url(resource.access.url).path : "https://internal.example.com" + url(resource.access.url).path}'

Non-wget source: reference an access-specific field (OCI imageReference)
targetURL: '${"https://mirror.example.com/" + resource.access.imageReference}'
```

Referencing a field that is absent at execution time fails the transfer with a
clear error rather than producing a partial URL.
