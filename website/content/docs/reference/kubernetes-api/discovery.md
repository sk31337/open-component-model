A **Discovery** publishes a filtered, optionally projected view of the transitive
reference graph of a `Component`. It resolves the entire reachable graph from the
`Component`'s resolved repository, applies reference, component, and resource
selectors, and either publishes the filtered raw v2 descriptors or projects them
into free-form records with CEL expressions.

Discovery is read-only: it creates no external resources, downloads no artifacts,
and provides no signature-verification guarantees for the descriptors it filters.
See [Component Discovery]({{< relref "docs/concepts/component-discovery.md" >}})
for selectors, extraction, and status semantics, and the
[Discover Component Graphs]({{< relref "docs/how-to/discover-component-graphs.md" >}})
how-to guide for a worked example.
