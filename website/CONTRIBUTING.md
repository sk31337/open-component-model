# Contributing to the OCM Website

This guide covers development on the OCM project website in `website/`. For the general contribution process, see the
[central contributing guide](https://ocm.software/community/contributing/).

## Overview

The website is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using the [Thulite/Doks](https://getdoks.org/) theme and hosted
at [ocm.software](https://ocm.software). Documentation follows the [Diataxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/), which
organizes content into tutorials, how-to guides, explanations, and reference material.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** and **npm** (see version requirements in `engines` in `package.json`)
- Hugo is installed automatically via the `hugo-extended` npm package - you do not need to install it separately

## Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies (includes Hugo)
cd website
npm ci

# Start the development server
npm run dev

# Start with draft content visible
npm run dev:drafts

# Build the site
npm run build
```

The dev server runs at `http://localhost:1313` with live reload.

## Linting

Markdown linting is run from the repository root using the shared tooling:

```bash
# Lint all Markdown files across the repo (from the repository root)
task tools:markdownlint

# Lint with auto-fix
task tools:markdownlint -- --fix
```

The website also has ESLint configured for JavaScript:

```bash
cd website
npm run lint:scripts

# Lint and auto-fix
npm run lint:scripts:fix
```

## Content Authoring Guide

The rest of this document covers how to create and place documentation content. All new content should follow the
[Diataxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/). You may notice some inconsistencies with the current structure - improvements
are welcome.

## Diataxis Overview

Diataxis organizes documentation into four types based on user needs:

| Type              | User Need            | Characteristics                           |
|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Tutorials**     | "Help me learn"      | Learning-oriented, guided, step-by-step   |
| **How-to Guides** | "Help me do X"       | Task-oriented, assumes competence         |
| **Explanation**   | "Help me understand" | Understanding-oriented, discusses "why"   |
| **Reference**     | "Give me facts"      | Information-oriented, describes machinery |

Each type serves a distinct purpose. Mixing types within a single document confuses readers and reduces effectiveness.

- **[Tutorial Template](./content_templates/template-tutorial.md)**
  - Complete guide for creating learning-oriented tutorials
  - Includes examples for Mermaid diagrams, `{{< steps >}}`, `{{< tabs >}}`, and `{{< details >}}` shortcodes
  - Shows how to structure prerequisites, scenarios, and success indicators
  - Provides checklist for publication readiness

- **[How-to Template](./content_templates/template-how-to.md)**
  - Task-focused guide template
  - Demonstrates goal-oriented structure
  - Shows troubleshooting format with symptom-cause-fix
  - Includes examples for `{{< tabs >}}` and `{{< card-grid >}}` shortcodes

- **[Concept Template](./content_templates/template-concept.md)**
  - Explanation-oriented template for design decisions and rationale
  - Focuses on "why" rather than "how"

These templates include inline comments and examples to guide you through creating high-quality documentation that follows Diataxis principles.

## Repository Placement Guide

Documentation lives in different repositories depending on what it documents.

### Source Repositories

| Repository                                  | Status     | Components                              |
|---------------------------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `open-component-model/open-component-model` | Active     | CLI, Go library, Kubernetes controllers |
| `open-component-model/ocm`                  | Legacy     | CLI tool, Go library (v0.x)             |

### Feature-Based Decision Tree

```text
What are you documenting?

CLI command/flag in the legacy CLI (open-component-model/ocm)?
  -> website/content_versioned/version-legacy/docs/reference/
CLI command/flag in the current CLI?
  -> bindings/go/cli/docs/reference/ (Hugo mounts this into the website automatically)

Go library function/type?
  -> Source repo documentation, available as Go package documentation

Kubernetes controller / CRD / Helm Chart?
  -> bindings/go/kubernetes/controller/ has CRD definitions and controller Helm Charts

A new way to start using OCM?
  -> website/content/docs/getting-started/
User workflow spanning multiple tools step-by-step?
  -> website/content/docs/tutorials/
A specific process or enablement of a concrete goal?
  -> website/content/docs/how-to/
Conceptual explanation of OCM?
  -> website/content/docs/concepts/
```

### Marking Version-Specific Content

When content applies to a specific version or repository, add a callout:

```markdown
{{<callout context="note" title="" icon="">}}
This guide applies to OCM CLI v0.x. See [link] for the new library.
{{</callout>}}
```

```markdown
{{<callout context="note" title="" icon="">}}
This feature requires the new OCM library from `open-component-model/open-component-model`.
{{</callout>}}
```

You can find appropriate icons on this [website](https://tabler.io/icons).

## Page URLs and Renames

A docs page URL is `/docs/<sections>/<slug>/`. The slug defaults to the page title, so a title change moves the page
and breaks every existing link to it.

- Pin the URL with an explicit `slug` in the front matter if the page is linked from outside this repository, above
  all from Go code. A released binary prints the URL it was compiled with forever, and that link cannot be corrected
  afterwards.
- Keep the old URL alive with `aliases` if a page moves. Hugo writes a redirect page for each alias. GitHub Pages
  serves the site and does not support server-side redirects, so `aliases` is the only mechanism available.

```yaml
---
title: "Sign Component Versions"
slug: "sign-component-versions"
aliases:
  - /docs/getting-started/sign-component-versions/
---
```
