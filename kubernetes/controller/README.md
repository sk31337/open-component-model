# OCM Kubernetes Controller Toolkit

> [!CAUTION]
> This project is in early development and not yet ready for production use.

The OCM Kubernetes Controller Toolkit

- supports the deployment of an OCM component and its resources, like Helm charts or other manifests,
into a Kubernetes cluster with the help of kro and a deployer, e.g. FluxCD.
- provides a controller to transfer OCM components.

## What should I know before I start?

You should be familiar with the following concepts:

- [Open Component Model](https://ocm.software/)
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) ecosystem
- [kro](https://kro.run)
- Kubernetes resource deployer such as [FluxCD](https://fluxcd.io/).
- [Task](https://taskfile.dev/)

## Concept

> [!NOTE]
> The following section provides a high-level overview of the OCM Kubernetes Controller Toolkit and its components
> regarding the deployment of an OCM resource in a very basic scenario.

The primary purpose of OCM Kubernetes Controller Toolkit is simple: Deploy an OCM resource from an OCM component
version into a Kubernetes cluster.

The diagram below provides an overview of the architecture of the OCM Kubernetes Controller Toolkit.

## Installation

Take a look at our [installation guide](https://ocm.software/docs/getting-started/set-up-controller-environments/#install-the-ocm-controllers) to get started.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> While the OCM Kubernetes Controller Toolkit technically can be used standalone, it requires kro and a deployer,
> e.g. FluxCD, to deploy an OCM resource into a Kubernetes cluster. The OCM Kubernetes Controller Toolkit
> deployment, however, does not contain kro or any deployer. Please refer to the respective installation guides
> for these tools:
>
> - [kro](https://kro.run/docs/getting-started/Installation/)
> - [FluxCD](https://fluxcd.io/docs/installation/)
