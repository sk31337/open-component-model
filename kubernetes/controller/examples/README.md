# Examples

This directory contains end-to-end examples demonstrating how to use the OCM Kubernetes Controller Toolkit.
Each example is self-contained: it includes a component definition (`component-constructor.yaml`), a bootstrap
manifest (`bootstrap.yaml`), and — where deployment is needed — a kro `ResourceGraphDefinition` (`rgd.yaml`)
and an instance manifest (`instance.yaml`).

## Prerequisites

A local Kind cluster with kro, FluxCD, and ArgoCD installed. Use the Taskfile to set it up:

```bash
task test/e2e/setup/local
```

See the [installation notes in the root README](../README.md#installation) for details.

| [`helm-nested`](#helm-nested) | FluxCD + ArgoCD | Helm chart buried in a nested OCM component reference |
| [`helm-nested-signed`](#helm-nested-signed) | FluxCD + ArgoCD | Nested component with signature verification |
| [`helm-signing`](#helm-signing) | FluxCD + ArgoCD | Deploying a signed Helm chart with key verification |
| [`helm-simple-nested-status`](#helm-simple-nested-status) | FluxCD + ArgoCD | Exposing nested resource status fields through `additionalStatusFields` |
| [`helm-configuration-localization`](#helm-configuration-localization) | FluxCD + ArgoCD | Image localization + Helm value injection |
| [`kustomize-simple`](#kustomize-simple) | FluxCD + ArgoCD | Kustomize overlay from a Git-sourced OCM resource |
| [`kustomize-configuration-localization`](#kustomize-configuration-localization) | FluxCD + ArgoCD | Image localization via Kustomize JSON patches |
| [`k8s-manifest-simple`](#k8s-manifest-simple) | (raw kubectl) | Applying a plain Kubernetes manifest from an OCM resource |
| [`applyset-pruning`](#applyset-pruning) | (raw kubectl) | Pruning orphaned resources with ApplySet |

All examples that use FluxCD and ArgoCD include **both deployer blocks** in the same `rgd.yaml`. kro
instantiates both; on a cluster where only one is installed, remove the block for the absent deployer.

## helm-simple

**Deployers:** FluxCD (`OCIRepository` + `HelmRelease`) and ArgoCD (`Application`)

The baseline example. A single Helm chart resource is resolved from an OCM component and deployed via both
FluxCD and ArgoCD. This is the best starting point for understanding how the toolkit's resource pipeline works.

The `Resource` exposes OCI coordinates (`registry`, `repository`, `digest`, `tag`) in `status.additional.*`.
FluxCD pins to the digest for secure pulls; ArgoCD references the tag (digest pinning is not supported for
ArgoCD Helm OCI sources).

```bash
# Run this example in isolation
task test/e2e -- -ginkgo.focus=helm-simple
```

---

## helm-nested

**Deployers:** FluxCD + ArgoCD

Demonstrates how to reference a Helm chart that lives inside a _nested_ OCM component reference (i.e., an OCM
component version that itself references another component). The `Resource` spec uses `referencePath` to
navigate the nesting:

```yaml
resource:
  byReference:
    resource:
      name: helm-resource
    referencePath:
      - name: nested-chart
```

---

## helm-nested-signed

**Deployers:** FluxCD + ArgoCD

Like `helm-nested`, but the OCM component version is signed. The `Resource` controller verifies the signature
using the public key provided in `ocm.software.pub` before exposing the OCI artifact coordinates.

---

## helm-signing

**Deployers:** FluxCD + ArgoCD

Demonstrates signature verification for a top-level (non-nested) OCM resource. The private key is used during
`task test/e2e` to sign the component version during the test setup phase; the controller verifies it at runtime.

---

## helm-simple-nested-status

**Deployers:** FluxCD + ArgoCD

Shows how to surface additional fields from an OCM resource's access information using `additionalStatusFields`.
Useful when the RGD needs to pass registry coordinates (registry, repository, digest, tag) to downstream
deployer resources via kro's `${...}` CEL expressions.

---

## helm-configuration-localization

**Deployers:** FluxCD + ArgoCD

The most comprehensive Helm example. Demonstrates two capabilities together:

- **Localization** — the chart's `image.repository` and `image.tag` are replaced with the transferred OCI image
  location, so the workload pulls from the local registry rather than the original upstream.
- **Configuration** — a user-defined `ui.message` value is injected into the running pod via Helm values.

FluxCD injects values through `HelmRelease.spec.values`; ArgoCD through
`Application.spec.source.helm.valuesObject`. The structured `valuesObject` field avoids escaping issues that
arise with the string-based `values` field.

```bash
task test/e2e -- -ginkgo.focus=helm-configuration-localization
```

---

## kustomize-simple

**Deployers:** FluxCD (`GitRepository` + `Kustomization`) and ArgoCD (`Application` with `source.path`)

Deploys a Kustomize overlay sourced from a Git repository referenced through an OCM resource. The commit SHA is
taken from `resource.status.resource.access.commit` and pinned in both the FluxCD `GitRepository` ref and the
ArgoCD `Application.spec.source.targetRevision`.

---

## kustomize-configuration-localization

**Deployers:** FluxCD + ArgoCD

Like `kustomize-simple`, but adds image localization and configuration via JSON Patch operations:

- **Localization** — replaces `spec.template.spec.containers[0].image` with the transferred OCI image reference.
- **Configuration** — injects `PODINFO_UI_MESSAGE` as an environment variable.

> **Note on kro + ArgoCD kustomize patches:** kro cannot parse multi-line YAML block scalars that contain
> `${…}` CEL expression references inside ArgoCD `kustomize.patches`. The workaround is to express those
> patches as inline JSON arrays (e.g. `'[{"op":"replace",…}]'`). Static patches (no CEL expressions) can
> continue to use normal YAML block scalars. See the `rgd.yaml` in this example for the pattern.

---

## k8s-manifest-simple

**Deployer:** none (raw `kubectl apply`)

Applies a raw Kubernetes manifest stored as an OCM resource, without using kro or a GitOps deployer. Useful as
a reference for the simplest possible OCM → cluster workflow.

---

## applyset-pruning

**Deployer:** none (ApplySet-based pruning)

Demonstrates how orphaned resources are pruned when an OCM component version is updated. Uses Kubernetes
[ApplySet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-kubernetes-objects/apply-set/) for pruning instead of a
GitOps deployer. This example has its own dedicated e2e test file (`test/e2e/e2e_applyset_test.go`) and is
excluded from the generic examples test loop.

---

## Running all examples

```bash
# Run every example in the generic loop (applyset-pruning is excluded — it has its own test)
task test/e2e

# Teardown the cluster, rebuild from scratch, and run all examples
task test/e2e/fresh

# Run a single example by name
task test/e2e -- -ginkgo.focus=helm-configuration-localization
```

See [Taskfile.yml](../Taskfile.yml) for the full list of e2e tasks and options.
