# Readme

The manifest files in this folder facilitate a simple replication of an OCM component from an external OCI registry to a one provided by the test setup:

- No explicit transfer options are specified, i.e. the defaults of the OCM library are used.
- No credentials are specified, i.e. it is a transport between two public registries.
