# Readme

The manifest files in this folder facilitate two ocm transfer operations:

1. From an external registry to a one which is part of the test setup. The target registry is password-protected.
2. From one password-protected registry to a yet another one.

Besides configuration of required credentials, both transfer operations use certain explicitly set transfer options.
